Predict response for new data.

!!! note
    Currently, no in-place methods are provided because these methods
    internally construct a new model and therefore allocate not just a
    response vector but also many other matrices.

!!! warning
    Models are assumed to be full rank.

!!! warning
    These methods construct an entire MixedModel behind the scenes and
    as such may use a large amount of memory when `newdata` is large.

The keyword argument `new_re_levels` specifies how previously unobserved
values of the grouping variable are handled. Possible values are
`:population` (return population values, i.e. fixed-effects only),
`:missing` (return `missing`), `:error` (error on this condition;
the error type is an implementation detail). If you want simulated values
for unobserved levels of the grouping variable, consider the
[`simulate!`](@ref) and `simulate` methods.

Predictions based purely on the fixed effects can be obtained by
specifying previously unobserved levels of the random effects and setting
`new_re_levels=:population`. In the future, it may be possible to specify
a subset of the grouping variables or overall random-effects structure to use,
but not at this time.

For `GeneralizedLinearMixedModel`, the `type` parameter specifies
whether the predictions should be returned on the scale of linear predictor
(`:linpred`) or on the response scale (`:response`). If you don't know the
difference between these terms, then you probably want `type=:response`.

Regression weights are not yet supported in prediction.
Similarly, offsets are also not supported for `GeneralizedLinearMixedModel`.
