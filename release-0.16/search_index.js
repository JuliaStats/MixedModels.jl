    "text": "In a linear mixed model the unconditional distribution of mathcalB and the conditional distribution, (mathcalY  mathcalB=bfb), are both multivariate Gaussian distributions, \\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned}   (\\mathcal{Y} | \\mathcal{B}=\\bf{b}) &\\sim\\mathcal{N}(\\bf{ X\\beta + Z b},\\sigma^2\\bf{I})\\\\\n  \\mathcal{B}&\\sim\\mathcal{N}(\\bf{0},\\Sigma_\\theta) . \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}The conditional mean of mathcal Y, given mathcal B=bf b, is the linear predictor, bf Xbfbeta+bf Zbf b, which depends on the p-dimensional fixed-effects parameter, bf beta, and on bf b. The model matrices, bf X and bf Z, of dimension ntimes p and ntimes q, respectively, are determined from the formula for the model and the values of covariates.  Although the matrix bf Z can be large (i.e. both n and q can be large), it is sparse (i.e. most of the elements in the matrix are zero).The relative covariance factor, Lambda_theta, is a qtimes q lower-triangular matrix, depending on the variance-component parameter, bftheta, and generating the symmetric qtimes q variance-covariance matrix, Sigma_theta, as \\begin{equation}   \\Sigma_\\theta=\\sigma^2\\Lambda_\\theta\\Lambda_\\theta\' \\end{equation}The spherical random effects, mathcalUsimmathcalN(bf 0sigma^2bf I_q), determine mathcal B according to \\begin{equation}   \\mathcal{B}=\\Lambda_\\theta\\mathcal{U}. \\end{equation}The penalized residual sum of squares (PRSS), \\begin{equation}   r^2(\\theta,\\beta,{\\bf u})=\\|{\\bf y} -{\\bf X}\\beta -{\\bf Z}\\Lambda_\\theta{\\bf u}\\|^2+\\|{\\bf u}\\|^2, \\end{equation} is the sum of the residual sum of squares, measuring fidelity of the model to the data, and a penalty on the size of bf u, measuring the complexity of the model. Minimizing r^2 with respect to bf u, \\begin{equation}   r^2_{\\beta,\\theta} =\\min_{\\bf u}\\left(\\|{\\bf y} -{\\bf X}{\\beta} -{\\bf Z}\\Lambda_\\theta{\\bf u}\\|^2+\\|{\\bf u}\\|^2\\right) \\end{equation} is a direct (i.e. non-iterative) computation. The particular method used to solve this generates a blocked Choleksy factor, bf L_theta, which is an lower triangular qtimes q matrix satisfying \\begin{equation}   {\\bf L}_\\theta{\\bf L}_\\theta\'=\\Lambda_\\theta\'{\\bf Z}\'{\\bf Z}\\Lambda_\\theta+{\\bf I}_q . \\end{equation} where bf I_q is the qtimes q identity matrix.Negative twice the log-likelihood of the parameters, given the data, bf y, is \\begin{equation} d({\\bf\\theta},{\\bf\\beta},\\sigma|{\\bf y}) =n\\log(2\\pi\\sigma^2)+\\log(|{\\bf L}_\\theta|^2)+\\frac{r^2_{\\beta,\\theta}}{\\sigma^2}. \\end{equation} where bf L_theta denotes the determinant of bf L_theta. Because bf L_theta is triangular, its determinant is the product of its diagonal elements.Because the conditional mean, bfmu_mathcal Ymathcal B=bf b=bf Xbfbeta+bf ZLambda_thetabf u, is a linear function of both bfbeta and bf u, minimization of the PRSS with respect to both bfbeta and bf u to produce \\begin{equation} r^2_\\theta =\\min_{{\\bf\\beta},{\\bf u}}\\left(\\|{\\bf y} -{\\bf X}{\\bf\\beta} -{\\bf Z}\\Lambda_\\theta{\\bf u}\\|^2+\\|{\\bf u}\\|^2\\right) \\end{equation} is also a direct calculation. The values of bf u and bfbeta that provide this minimum are called, respectively, the conditional mode, tildebf u_theta, of the spherical random effects and the conditional estimate, widehatbfbeta_theta, of the fixed effects. At the conditional estimate of the fixed effects the objective is \\begin{equation} d({\\bf\\theta},\\widehat{\\beta}_\\theta,\\sigma|{\\bf y}) =n\\log(2\\pi\\sigma^2)+\\log(|{\\bf L}_\\theta|^2)+\\frac{r^2_\\theta}{\\sigma^2}. \\end{equation}Minimizing this expression with respect to sigma^2 produces the conditional estimate \\begin{equation} \\widehat{\\sigma^2}_\\theta=\\frac{r^2_\\theta}{n} \\end{equation} which provides the profiled log-likelihood on the deviance scale as \\begin{equation} \\tilde{d}(\\theta|{\\bf y})=d(\\theta,\\widehat{\\beta}_\\theta,\\widehat{\\sigma}_\\theta|{\\bf y}) =\\log(|{\\bf L}_\\theta|^2)+n\\left[1+\\log\\left(\\frac{2\\pi r^2_\\theta}{n}\\right)\\right], \\end{equation} a function of bftheta alone.The MLE of bftheta, written widehatbftheta, is the value that minimizes this profiled objective. We determine this value by numerical optimization. In the process of evaluating tilded(widehatthetabf y) we determine widehatbeta=widehatbeta_widehattheta, tildebf u_widehattheta and r^2_widehattheta, from which we can evaluate widehatsigma=sqrtr^2_widehatthetan.The elements of the conditional mode of mathcal B, evaluated at the parameter estimates, \\begin{equation} \\tilde{\\bf b}_{\\widehat{\\theta}}= \\Lambda_{\\widehat{\\theta}}\\tilde{\\bf u}_{\\widehat{\\theta}} \\end{equation} are sometimes called the best linear unbiased predictors or BLUPs of the random effects. Although BLUPs an appealing acronym, I don’t find the term particularly instructive (what is a “linear unbiased predictor” and in what sense are these the “best”?) and prefer the term “conditional modes”, because these are the values of bf b that maximize the density of the conditional distribution mathcalB  mathcalY = bf y. For a linear mixed model, where all the conditional and unconditional distributions are Gaussian, these values are also the conditional means."

    "text": "To ensure identifiability of Sigma_theta=sigma^2Lambda_theta Lambda_theta, the elements of theta corresponding to diagonal elements of Lambda_theta are constrained to be non-negative. For example, in a trivial case of a single, simple, scalar, random-effects term as in fm1, the one-dimensional theta vector is the ratio of the standard deviation of the random effects to the standard deviation of the response. It happens that -theta produces the same log-likelihood but, by convention, we define the standard deviation to be the positive square root of the variance. Requiring the diagonal elements of Lambda_theta to be non-negative is a generalization of using this positive square root.If the optimization converges on the boundary of the feasible region, that is if one or more of the diagonal elements of Lambda_theta is zero at convergence, the covariance matrix Sigma_theta will be singular. This means that there will be linear combinations of random effects that are constant. Usually convergence to a singular covariance matrix is a sign of an over-specified model."

    "text": "In a generalized linear model the responses are modelled as coming from a particular distribution, such as Bernoulli for binary responses or Poisson for responses that represent counts. The scalar distributions of individual responses differ only in their means, which are determined by a linear predictor expression eta=bf Xbeta, where, as before, bf X is a model matrix derived from the values of covariates and beta is a vector of coefficients.The unconstrained components of eta are mapped to the, possiby constrained, components of the mean response, mu, via a scalar function, g^-1, applied to each component of eta. For historical reasons, the inverse of this function, taking components of mu to the corresponding component of eta is called the link function and more frequently used map from eta to mu is the inverse link.A generalized linear mixed-effects model (GLMM) is defined, for the purposes of this package, by \\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned}   (\\mathcal{Y} | \\mathcal{B}=\\bf{b}) &\\sim\\mathcal{D}(\\bf{g^{-1}(X\\beta + Z b)},\\phi)\\\\\n  \\mathcal{B}&\\sim\\mathcal{N}(\\bf{0},\\Sigma_\\theta) . \\end{aligned} \\end{equation} where mathcalD indicates the distribution family parameterized by the mean and, when needed, a common scale parameter, phi. (There is no scale parameter for Bernoulli or for Poisson. Specifying the mean completely determines the distribution.)Bernoulli\nPoissonThe glmm function generates, but does not fit, a GeneralizedLinearMixedModel object.julia> mdl = glmm(@formula(r2 ~ 1 + a + g + b + s + (1|id) + (1|item)),\n           dat[:VerbAgg], Bernoulli());\n\njulia> typeof(mdl)\nMixedModels.GeneralizedLinearMixedModel{Float64}\nA separate call to fit! is required to fit the model. This involves optimizing an objective function, the Laplace approximation to the deviance, with respect to the parameters, which are beta, the fixed-effects coefficients, and theta, the covariance parameters.

These are the values that maximize the conditional density of the random effects, given the model parameters and the data. This is done using Penalized Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (PIRLS). In most cases PIRLS is fast and stable. It is simply a penalized version of the IRLS algorithm used in fitting GLMs.The distinction between the \"fast\" and \"slow\" algorithms in the MixedModels package (nAGQ=0 or nAGQ=1 in lme4) is whether the fixed-effects parameters, beta, are optimized in PIRLS or in the nonlinear optimizer. In a call to the pirls! function the first argument is a GeneralizedLinearMixedModel, which is modified during the function call. (By convention, the names of such mutating functions end in ! as a warning to the user that they can modify an argument, usually the first argument.) The second and third arguments are optional logical values indicating if beta is to be varied and if verbose output is to be printed.julia> pirls!(mdl, true, true)\nvaryβ = true\nobj₀ = 10210.8534389054\nβ = [0.206053, 0.0399404, 0.231317, -0.794186, -1.53919, -0.776656]\niter = 1\nobj = 8301.483049027265\niter = 2\nobj = 8205.604285133919\niter = 3\nobj = 8201.896597466888\niter = 4\nobj = 8201.848598910705\niter = 5\nobj = 8201.848559060703\n8201.848559060703\njulia> LaplaceDeviance(mdl)\n8201.848559060703\njulia> mdl.β\n6-element Array{Float64,1}:\n  0.218535 \n  0.0514385\n  0.290225 \n -0.979124 \n -1.95402  \n -0.979493 \njulia> mdl.θ # current values of the standard deviations of the random effects\n2-element Array{Float64,1}:\n 1.0\n 1.0\nIf the optimization with respect to beta is performed within PIRLS then the nonlinear optimization of the Laplace approximation to the deviance requires optimization with respect to theta only.

Because it is slower to incorporate the beta parameters in the general nonlinear optimization, the fast fit is performed first and used to determine starting estimates for the more general

    "text": "Bootstrapping is a family of procedures for generating sample values of a statistic, allowing for visualization of the distribution of the statistic or for inference from this sample of values.A _parametric bootstrap_ is used with a parametric model, m, that has been fitted to data. The procedure is to simulate n response vectors from m using the estimated parameter values and refit m to these responses in turn, accumulating the statistics of interest at each iteration.The parameters of a linear mixed-effects model as fit by the lmm function are the fixed-effects parameters, β, the standard deviation, σ, of the per-observation noise, and the covariance parameter, θ, that defines the variance-covariance matrices of the random effects.For example, a simple linear mixed-effects model for the Dyestuff data in the lme4 package for R is fit byjulia> using DataFrames, Gadfly, MixedModels, RData\njulia> ds = names!(dat[:Dyestuff], [:Batch, :Yield])\n30×2 DataFrames.DataFrame\n│ Row │ Batch │ Yield  │\n├─────┼───────┼────────┤\n│ 1   │ \"A\"   │ 1545.0 │\n│ 2   │ \"A\"   │ 1440.0 │\n│ 3   │ \"A\"   │ 1440.0 │\n│ 4   │ \"A\"   │ 1520.0 │\n│ 5   │ \"A\"   │ 1580.0 │\n│ 6   │ \"B\"   │ 1540.0 │\n│ 7   │ \"B\"   │ 1555.0 │\n│ 8   │ \"B\"   │ 1490.0 │\n⋮\n│ 22  │ \"E\"   │ 1630.0 │\n│ 23  │ \"E\"   │ 1515.0 │\n│ 24  │ \"E\"   │ 1635.0 │\n│ 25  │ \"E\"   │ 1625.0 │\n│ 26  │ \"F\"   │ 1520.0 │\n│ 27  │ \"F\"   │ 1455.0 │\n│ 28  │ \"F\"   │ 1450.0 │\n│ 29  │ \"F\"   │ 1480.0 │\n│ 30  │ \"F\"   │ 1445.0 │\n\njulia> m1 = fit!(lmm(@formula(Yield ~ 1 + (1 | Batch)), ds))\nLinear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood\n Formula: Yield ~ 1 + (1 | Batch)\n   logLik   -2 logLik     AIC        BIC    \n -163.66353  327.32706  333.32706  337.53065\n\nVariance components:\n              Column    Variance  Std.Dev. \n Batch    (Intercept)  1388.3333 37.260345\n Residual              2451.2500 49.510100\n Number of obs: 30; levels of grouping factors: 6\n\n  Fixed-effects parameters:\n             Estimate Std.Error z value P(>|z|)\n(Intercept)    1527.5   17.6946  86.326  <1e-99\n\n"

The three arguments to bootstrap! are the matrix that will be overwritten with the results, the model to bootstrap, and a function that overwrites a vector with the results of interest from the model.Suppose the objective is to obtain 100,000 parametric bootstrap samples of the estimates of the \"variance components\", σ² and σ₁², in this model.  In many implementations of mixed-effects models the estimate of σ₁², the variance of the scalar random effects, is reported along with a standard error, as if the estimator could be assumed to have a Gaussian distribution. Is this a reasonable assumption?A suitable function to save the results isjulia> function saveresults!(v, m)\n    v[1] = varest(m)\n    v[2] = abs2(getθ(m)[1]) * v[1]\nend\nsaveresults! (generic function with 1 method)\nThe varest extractor function returns the estimate of σ².  As seen above, the estimate of the σ₁ is the product of Θ and the estimate of σ.  The expression abs2(getΘ(m)[1]) evaluates to Θ². The [1] is necessary because the value returned by getθ is a vector and a scalar is needed here.As with any simulation-based method, it is advisable to set the random number seed before calling bootstrap! for reproducibility.julia> srand(1234321);\njulia> results = bootstrap!(zeros(2, 100000), m1, saveresults!);\nThe results for each bootstrap replication are stored in the columns of the matrix passed in as the first argument.

However, the distribution of the bootstrap samples of the estimate of σ₁² is highly skewed and has a spike at zero."

We also describe methods of assessing the precision of the parameter estimates and of visualizing the conditional distribution of the random effects, given the observed data."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "Mixed-effects models, like many other types of statistical models, describe a relationship between a response variable and some of the covariates that have been measured or observed along with the response. In mixed-effects models at least one of the covariates is a categorical covariate representing experimental or observational “units” in the data set. In the example from the chemical industry discussed in this chapter, the observational unit is the batch of an intermediate product used in production of a dye. In medical and social sciences the observational units are often the human or animal subjects in the study. In agriculture the experimental units may be the plots of land or the specific plants being studied.In all of these cases the categorical covariate or covariates are observed at a set of discrete levels. We may use numbers, such as subject identifiers, to designate the particular levels that we observed but these numbers are simply labels. The important characteristic of a categorical covariate is that, at each observed value of the response, the covariate takes on the value of one of a set of distinct levels.Parameters associated with the particular levels of a covariate are sometimes called the “effects” of the levels. If the set of possible levels of the covariate is fixed and reproducible we model the covariate using fixed-effects parameters. If the levels that were observed represent a random sample from the set of all possible levels we incorporate random effects in the model.There are two things to notice about this distinction between fixed-effects parameters and random effects. First, the names are misleading because the distinction between fixed and random is more a property of the levels of the categorical covariate than a property of the effects associated with them. Secondly, we distinguish between “fixed-effects parameters”, which are indeed parameters in the statistical model, and “random effects”, which, strictly speaking, are not parameters. As we will see shortly, random effects are unobserved random variables.To make the distinction more concrete, suppose the objective is to model the annual reading test scores for students in a school district and that the covariates recorded with the score include a student identifier and the student’s gender. Both of these are categorical covariates. The levels of the gender covariate, male and female, are fixed. If we consider data from another school district or we incorporate scores from earlier tests, we will not change those levels. On the other hand, the students whose scores we observed would generally be regarded as a sample from the set of all possible students whom we could have observed. Adding more data, either from more school districts or from results on previous or subsequent tests, will increase the number of distinct levels of the student identifier.Mixed-effects models or, more simply, mixed models are statistical models that incorporate both fixed-effects parameters and random effects. Because of the way that we will define random effects, a model with random effects always includes at least one fixed-effects parameter. Thus, any model with random effects is a mixed model.We characterize the statistical model in terms of two random variables: a q-dimensional vector of random effects represented by the random variable mathcalB and an n-dimensional response vector represented by the random variable mathcalY. (We use upper-case “script” characters to denote random variables. The corresponding lower-case upright letter denotes a particular value of the random variable.) We observe the value, bfy, of mathcalY. We do not observe the value, bfb, of mathcalB.When formulating the model we describe the unconditional distribution of mathcalB and the conditional distribution, (mathcalYmathcalB=bfb). The descriptions of the distributions involve the form of the distribution and the values of certain parameters. We use the observed values of the response and the covariates to estimate these parameters and to make inferences about them.That’s the big picture. Now let’s make this more concrete by describing a particular, versatile class of mixed models called linear mixed models and by studying a simple example of such a model. First we describe the data in the example."

In the experiment six samples of the intermediate, representing different batches of works manufacture, were obtained, and five preparations of the dyestuff were made in the laboratory from each sample.

For example, four of the five preparations from batch F provided lower yields than did any of the preparations from batches B, C, and E.Recall that the labels for the batches are just labels and that their ordering is arbitrary. In a plot, however, the order of the levels influences the perception of the pattern. Rather than providing an arbitrary pattern it is best to order the levels according to some criterion for the plot. In this case a good choice is to order the batches by increasing mean yield, which can be easily done in R.(Note: at present this plot fails because of the ongoing DataFrames conversion.)julia> #dyestuff = rcopy(\"within(Dyestuff, Batch <- reorder(Batch, Yield, mean))\");\n#plot(dyestuff, x=\"Y\", y=\"G\", point, xlabel(\"Yield of dyestuff (g)\"))\nIn Sect. [sec:DyestuffLMM] we will use mixed models to quantify the variability in yield between batches. For the time being let us just note that the particular batches used in this experiment are a selection or sample from the set of all batches that we wish to consider. Furthermore, the extent to which one particular batch tends to increase or decrease the mean yield of the process — in other words, the “effect” of that particular batch on the yield — is not as interesting to us as is the extent of the variability between batches. For the purposes of designing, monitoring and controlling a process we want to predict the yield from future batches, taking into account the batch-to-batch variability and the within-batch variability. Being able to estimate the extent to which a particular batch in the past increased or decreased the yield is not usually an important goal for us. We will model the effects of the batches as random effects rather than as fixed-effects parameters."

The summary provides several other model-fit statistics such as Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC), Schwarz’s Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), the log-likelihood at the parameter estimates, and the objective function (negative twice the log-likelihood) at the parameter estimates. These are all statistics related to the model fit and are used to compare different models fit to the same data.The third section is the table of estimates of parameters associated with the random effects. There are two sources of variability in this model, a batch-to-batch variability in the level of the response and the residual or per-observation variability — also called the within-batch variability. The name “residual” is used in statistical modeling to denote the part of the variability that cannot be explained or modeled with the other terms. It is the variation in the observed data that is “left over” after determining the estimates of the parameters in the other parts of the model.Some of the variability in the response is associated with the fixed-effects terms. In this model there is only one such term, labeled the (Intercept). The name “intercept”, which is better suited to models based on straight lines written in a slope/intercept form, should be understood to represent an overall “typical” or mean level of the response in this case. (For those wondering about the parentheses around the name, they are included so that a user cannot accidentally name a variable in conflict with this name.) The line labeled Batch in the random effects table shows that the random effects added to the intercept term, one for each level of the factor, are modeled as random variables whose unconditional variance is estimated as 1388.33 g^2. The corresponding standard deviations is 37.26 g for the ML fit.Note that the last column in the random effects summary table is the estimate of the variability expressed as a standard deviation rather than as a variance. These are provided because it is usually easier to visualize the variability in standard deviations, which are on the scale of the response, than it is to visualize the magnitude of a variance. The values in this column are a simple re-expression (the square root) of the estimated variances. Do not confuse them with the standard errors of the variance estimators, which are not given here. As described in later sections, standard errors of variance estimates are generally not useful because the distribution of the estimator of a variance is skewed - often badly skewed.The line labeled Residual in this table gives the estimate, 2451.25 g^2, of the variance of the residuals and the corresponding standard deviation, 49.51 g. In written descriptions of the model the residual variance parameter is written sigma^2 and the variance of the random effects is sigma_1^2. Their estimates are widehatsigma^2 and widehatsigma_1^2The last line in the random effects table states the number of observations to which the model was fit and the number of levels of any “grouping factors” for the random effects. In this case we have a single random effects term, (1 | Batch), in the model formula and the grouping factor for that term is Batch. There will be a total of six random effects, one for each level of Batch.The final part of the printed display gives the estimates and standard errors of any fixed-effects parameters in the model. The only fixed-effects term in the model formula is the (Intercept). The estimate of this parameter is 1527.5 g. The standard error of the intercept estimate is 17.69 g."

Indeed Fig. [fig:Dyestuff2dot] shows that there is some small amount of variability between the groups. The estimate, widehatsigma_1, is a measure of the “between-group” variability that is in excess of the variability induced by the \"within-group\" or residual variability in the responses.  If 30 observations were simulated from a \"normal\" (also called \"Gaussian\") distribution and divided arbitrarily into 6 groups of 5, a plot of the data would look very much like Fig. [fig:Dyestuff2dot].  (In fact, it is likely that this is how that data set was generated.) It is only where there is excess variability between the groups that widehatsigma_10. Obtaining widehatsigma_1=0 is not a mistake; it is simply a statement about the data and the model.The important point to take away from this example is the need to allow for the estimates of variance components that are zero. Such a model is said to be singular, in the sense that it corresponds to a linear model in which we have removed the random effects associated with Batch. Singular models can and do occur in practice. Even when the final fitted model is not singular, we must allow for such models to be expressed when determining the parameter estimates through numerical optimization.It happens that this model corresponds to the linear model (i.e. a model with fixed-effects only)julia> lm1 = lm(@formula(Y ~ 1), dyestuff2)\nDataFrames.DataFrameRegressionModel{GLM.LinearModel{GLM.LmResp{Array{Float64,1}},GLM.DensePredChol{Float64,Base.LinAlg.Cholesky{Float64,Array{Float64,2}}}},Array{Float64,2}}\n\nFormula: Y ~ +1\n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.Error t value Pr(>|t|)\n(Intercept)    5.6656  0.678388 8.35156    <1e-8\n\nThe log-likelihood for this modeljulia> loglikelihood(lm1)\n-81.43651832691287\nis the same as that of fm2.

In a linear mixed model the unconditional distribution of mathcalB and the conditional distribution, (mathcalY  mathcalB=bfb), are both multivariate Gaussian distributions,\\begin{aligned}   (\\mathcal{Y} | \\mathcal{B}=\\bf{b}) &\\sim\\mathcal{N}(\\bf{ X\\beta + Z b},\\sigma^2\\bf{I})\\\\\n  \\mathcal{B}&\\sim\\mathcal{N}(\\bf{0},\\Sigma_\\theta) . \\end{aligned}The conditional mean of mathcal Y, given mathcal B=bf b, is the linear predictor, bf Xbfbeta+bf Zbf b, which depends on the p-dimensional fixed-effects parameter, bf beta, and on bf b. The model matrices, bf X and bf Z, of dimension ntimes p and ntimes q, respectively, are determined from the formula for the model and the values of covariates. Although the matrix bf Z can be large (i.e. both n and q can be large), it is sparse (i.e. most of the elements in the matrix are zero).The relative covariance factor, Lambda_theta, is a qtimes q lower-triangular matrix, depending on the variance-component parameter, bftheta, and generating the symmetric qtimes q variance-covariance matrix, Sigma_theta, as\\begin{equation}   \\Sigma_\\theta=\\sigma^2\\Lambda_\\theta\\Lambda_\\theta\' \\end{equation}The spherical random effects, mathcalUsimmathcalN(bf 0sigma^2bf I_q), determine mathcal B according to\\begin{equation}   \\mathcal{B}=\\Lambda_\\theta\\mathcal{U}. \\end{equation}The penalized residual sum of squares (PRSS),\\begin{equation}   r^2(\\theta,\\beta,{\\bf u})=\\|{\\bf y} -{\\bf X}\\beta -{\\bf Z}\\Lambda_\\theta{\\bf u}\\|^2+\\|{\\bf u}\\|^2, \\end{equation}is the sum of the residual sum of squares, measuring fidelity of the model to the data, and a penalty on the size of bf u, measuring the complexity of the model.

The particular method used to solve this generates a blocked Choleksy factor, bf L_theta, which is an lower triangular qtimes q matrix satisfying \\begin{equation}   {\\bf L}_\\theta{\\bf L}_\\theta\'=\\Lambda_\\theta\'{\\bf Z}\'{\\bf Z}\\Lambda_\\theta+{\\bf I}_q . \\end{equation} where bf I_q is the qtimes q identity matrix.Negative twice the log-likelihood of the parameters, given the data, bf y, is\\begin{equation} d({\\bf\\theta},{\\bf\\beta},\\sigma|{\\bf y}) =n\\log(2\\pi\\sigma^2)+\\log(|{\\bf L}_\\theta|^2)+\\frac{r^2_{\\beta,\\theta}}{\\sigma^2}. \\end{equation}where bf L_theta denotes the determinant of bf L_theta. Because bf L_theta is triangular, its determinant is the product of its diagonal elements.Negative twice the log-likelihood will be called the objective in what follows. It is the value to be minimized by the parameter estimates.  It is, up to an additive factor, the deviance of the parameters.  Unfortunately, it is not clear what the additive factor should be in the case of linear mixed models.  In many applications, however, it is not the deviance of the model that is of interest as much the change in the deviance between two fitted models.  When calculating the change in the deviance the additive factor will cancel out so the change in the deviance when comparing models is the same as the change in this objective.Because the conditional mean, bfmu_mathcal Ymathcal B=bf b=bf Xbfbeta+bf ZLambda_thetabf u, is a linear function of both bfbeta and bf u, minimization of the PRSS with respect to both bfbeta and bf u to produce\\begin{equation} r^2_\\theta =\\min_{{\\bf\\beta},{\\bf u}}\\left{\\|{\\bf y} -{\\bf X}{\\bf\\beta} -{\\bf Z}\\Lambda_\\theta{\\bf u}\\|^2+\\|{\\bf u}\\|^2\\right} \\end{equation}is also a direct calculation. The values of bf u and bfbeta that provide this minimum are called, respectively, the conditional mode, tildebf u_theta, of the spherical random effects and the conditional estimate, widehatbfbeta_theta, of the fixed effects. At the conditional estimate of the fixed effects the objective is\\begin{equation} d({\\bf\\theta},\\widehat{\\beta}_\\theta,\\sigma|{\\bf y}) =n\\log(2\\pi\\sigma^2)+\\log(|{\\bf L}_\\theta|^2)+\\frac{r^2_\\theta}{\\sigma^2}. \\end{equation}Minimizing this expression with respect to sigma^2 produces the conditional estimate\\begin{equation} \\widehat{\\sigma^2}_\\theta=\\frac{r^2_\\theta}{n} \\end{equation}which provides the profiled log-likelihood on the deviance scale as\\begin{equation} \\tilde{d}(\\theta|{\\bf y})=d(\\theta,\\widehat{\\beta}_\\theta,\\widehat{\\sigma}_\\theta|{\\bf y}) =\\log(|{\\bf L}_\\theta|^2)+n\\left[1+\\log\\left(\\frac{2\\pi r^2_\\theta}{n}\\right)\\right], \\end{equation} a function of bftheta alone.The MLE of bftheta, written widehatbftheta, is the value that minimizes this profiled objective. We determine this value by numerical optimization. In the process of evaluating tilded(widehatthetabf y) we determine widehatbeta=widehatbeta_widehattheta, tildebf u_widehattheta and r^2_widehattheta, from which we can evaluate widehatsigma=sqrtr^2_widehatthetan.The elements of the conditional mode of mathcal B, evaluated at the parameter estimates,\\begin{equation} \\tilde{\\bf b}_{\\widehat{\\theta}}= \\Lambda_{\\widehat{\\theta}}\\tilde{\\bf u}_{\\widehat{\\theta}} \\end{equation}are sometimes called the best linear unbiased predictors or BLUPs of the random effects. Although BLUPs an appealing acronym, I don’t find the term particularly instructive (what is a “linear unbiased predictor” and in what sense are these the “best”?) and prefer the term “conditional modes”, because these are the values of bf b that maximize the density of the conditional distribution mathcalB  mathcalY = bf y. For a linear mixed model, where all the conditional and unconditional distributions are Gaussian, these values are also the conditional means."

It is a block diagonal matrix where the diagonal blocks are Kronecker products of an identity matrix and a (small) lower triangular matrix.  The diagonal blocks correspond to the random-effects terms.

    "text": "I am a firm believer in the value of plotting results before summarizing them. Well chosen plots can provide insights not available from a simple numerical summary. It is common to visualize the distribution of a sample using a histogram, which approximates the shape of the probability density function. The density can also be approximated more smoothly using a kernel density plot. Finally, the extent to which the distribution of a sample can be approximated by a particular distribution or distribution family can be assessed by a quantile-quantile (qq) plot, the most common of which is the normal probability plot.The Gadfly package for Julia uses a \"grammar of graphics\" specification, similar to the ggplot2 package for R.  A histogram or a kernel density plot are describes as geometries and specified by Geom.histogram and Geom.density, respectively.julia> plot(mm1bstp, x = :β₁, Geom.histogram)\nPlot(...)\n(Image: )julia> plot(mm1bstp, x = :σ, Geom.histogram)\nPlot(...)\n(Image: )julia> plot(mm1bstp, x = :σ₁, Geom.histogram)\nPlot(...)\n(Image: )The last two histograms show that, even if the models are defined in terms of variances, the variance is usually not a good scale on which to assess the variability of the parameter estimates.  The standard deviation or, in some cases, the logarithm of the standard deviation is a more suitable scale.The histogram of sigma_1^2 has a \"spike\" at zero.  Because the value of sigma^2 is never zero, a value of sigma_1^2=0 must correspond to theta=0.  There are several ways to count the zeros in theta1.  The simplest is to use countnz, which counts the non-zeros, and subtrack that value from the total number of values in theta1.julia> length(mm1bstp[:θ₁]) - countnz(mm1bstp[:θ₁])\n941\nThat is, nearly 1/10 of the theta1 values are zeros.

A normal probability plot, which plots sample quantiles versus quantiles of the standard normal distribution, mathcalN(01), can be used to assess the validity of this assumption.  If the points fall approximately along a straight line, the assumption of normality should be valid.  Systematic departures from a straight line are cause for concern.In Gadfly a normal probability plot can be  constructed by specifying the statistic to be generated as Stat.qq and either x or y as the distribution Normal(). For the present purposes it is an advantage to put the theoretical quantiles on the x axis.This approach is suitable for small to moderate sample sizes, but not for sample sizes of 10,000.  To smooth the plot and to reduce the size of the plot files, we plot quantiles defined by a sequence of n \"probability points\".

    "category": "section",
    "text": "When the distribution of a parameter estimator is close to normal or to a T distribution, symmetric confidence intervals are an appropriate representation of the uncertainty in the parameter estimates.  However, they are not appropriate for skewed and/or bounded estimator distributions, such as those for sigma^2 and sigma_2^1 shown above.The fact that a symmetric confidence interval is not appropriate for sigma^2 should not be surprising.  In an introductory statistics course the calculation of a confidence interval on sigma^2 from a random sample of a normal distribution using quantiles of a chi^2 distribution is often introduced. So a symmetric confidence interval on sigma^2 is inappropriate in the simplest case but is often expected to be appropriate in much more complicated cases, as shown by the fact that many statistical software packages include standard errors of variance component estimates in the output from a mixed model fitting procedure.  Creating confidence intervals in this way is optimistic at best. Completely nonsensical would be another way of characterizing this approach.A more reasonable alternative for constructing a 1 - alpha confidence interval from a bootstrap sample is to report a contiguous interval that contains a 1 - alpha proportion of the sample values.But there are many such intervals.  Suppose that a 95% confidence interval was to be constructed from one of the samples of size 10,000 of bootstrapped values.  To get a contigous interval the sample should be sorted. The sorted sample values, also called the order statistics of the sample, are denoted by a bracketed subscript.  That is, sigma_1 is the smallest value in the sample, sigma_2 is the second smallest, up to sigma_10000, which is the largest.One possible interval containing 95% of the sample is (sigma_1 sigma_9500).  Another is (sigma_2 sigma_9501) and so on up to (sigma_501sigma_10000).  There needs to be a method of choosing one of these intervals.  On approach would be to always choose the central 95% of the sample.  That is, cut off 2.5% of the sample on the left side and 2.5% on the right side.  julia> sigma95 = quantile(mm1bstp[:σ], [0.025, 0.975])\n2-element Array{Float64,1}:\n 35.3694\n 62.9763\nThis approach has the advantage that the endpoints of a 95% interval on sigma^2 are the squares of the endpoints of a 95% interval on sigma.julia> isapprox(abs2.(sigma95), quantile(abs2.(mm1bstp[:σ]), [0.025, 0.975]))\ntrue\nThe intervals are compared with isapprox rather than exact equality because, in floating point arithmetic, it is not always the case that left(sqrtxright)^2 = x.  This comparison can also be expressed in Julia asjulia> abs2.(sigma95) ≈ quantile(abs2.(mm1bstp[:σ]), [0.025, 0.975])\ntrue\nAn alternative approach is to evaluate all of the contiguous intervals containing, say, 95% of the sample and return the shortest shortest such interval.  This is the equivalent of a Highest Posterior Density (HPD) interval sometimes used in Bayesian analysis.  If the procedure is applied to a unimodal (i.e. one that has only one peak or mode) theoretical probability density the resulting interval has the property that the density at the left endpoint is equal to the density at the right endpoint and that the density at any point outside the interval is less than the density at any point inside the interval.  Establishing this equivalence is left as an exercise for the mathematically inclined reader.  (Hint: Start with the interval defined by the \"equal density at the endpoints\" property and consider what happens if you shift that interval while maintaining the same area under the density curve.  You will be replacing a region of higher density by one with a lower density and the interval must become wider to maintain the same area.)With large samples a brute-force enumeration approach works.julia> function hpdinterval(v, level=0.95)\n    n = length(v)\n    if !(0 < level < 1)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"level = $level must be in (0, 1)\"))\n    end\n    if (lbd = floor(Int, (1 - level) * n)) < 2\n        throw(ArgumentError(\n            \"level = $level is too large from sample size $n\"))\n    end\n    ordstat = sort(v)\n    leftendpts = ordstat[1:lbd]\n    rtendpts = ordstat[(1 + n - lbd):n]\n    (w, ind) = findmin(rtendpts - leftendpts)\n    return [leftendpts[ind], rtendpts[ind]]\nend\nhpdinterval (generic function with 2 methods)\nFor example, the 95% HPD interval calculated from the sample of beta_1 values isjulia> hpdinterval(mm1bstp[:β₁])\n2-element Array{Float64,1}:\n 1492.49\n 1561.32\nwhich is very close to the central probability interval ofjulia> quantile(mm1bstp[:β₁], [0.025, 0.975])\n2-element Array{Float64,1}:\n 1492.45\n 1561.28\nbecause the empirical distribution of the beta_1 sample is very similar to a normal distribution.

    "category": "section",
    "text": "In Sect. [sec:definitions] we mentioned that what are sometimes called the BLUPs (or best linear unbiased predictors) of the random effects, mathcal B, are the conditional modes evaluated at the parameter estimates, calculated as tildeb_widehattheta=Lambda_widehatthetatildeu_widehattheta.These values are often considered as some sort of “estimates” of the random effects. It can be helpful to think of them this way but it can also be misleading. As we have stated, the random effects are not, strictly speaking, parameters—they are unobserved random variables. We don’t estimate the random effects in the same sense that we estimate parameters. Instead, we consider the conditional distribution of mathcal B given the observed data, (mathcal Bmathcal Y=mathbf  y).Because the unconditional distribution, mathcal BsimmathcalN(mathbf  0Sigma_theta) is continuous, the conditional distribution, (mathcal Bmathcal Y=mathbf  y) will also be continuous. In general, the mode of a probability density is the point of maximum density, so the phrase “conditional mode” refers to the point at which this conditional density is maximized. Because this definition relates to the probability model, the values of the parameters are assumed to be known. In practice, of course, we don’t know the values of the parameters (if we did there would be no purpose in forming the parameter estimates), so we use the estimated values of the parameters to evaluate the conditional modes.Those who are familiar with the multivariate Gaussian distribution may recognize that, because both mathcal B and (mathcal Ymathcal B=mathbf  b) are multivariate Gaussian, (mathcal Bmathcal Y=mathbf  y) will also be multivariate Gaussian and the conditional mode will also be the conditional mean of mathcal B, given mathcal Y=mathbf  y. This is the case for a linear mixed model but it does not carry over to other forms of mixed models. In the general case all we can say about tildemathbf    u or tildemathbf  b is that they maximize a conditional density, which is why we use the term “conditional mode” to describe these values. We will only use the term “conditional mean” and the symbol, mathbf mu, in reference to mathrmE(mathcal Ymathcal B=mathbf  b), which is the conditional mean of mathcal Y given mathcal B, and an important part of the formulation of all types of mixed-effects models.The ranef extractor returns the conditional modes.julia> ranef(mm1)  # FIXME return an ordered dict\n1-element Array{Array{Float64,2},1}:\n [-16.6282 0.369516 26.9747 -21.8014 53.5798 -42.4943]\nThe result is an array of matrices, one for each random effects term in the model.  In this case there is only one matrix because there is only one random-effects term, (1 | Batch), in the model. There is only one row in this matrix because the random-effects term, (1 | Batch), is a simple, scalar term.To make this more explicit, random-effects terms in the model formula are those that contain the vertical bar () character. The variable is the grouping factor for the random effects generated by this term. An expression for the grouping factor, usually just the name of a variable, occurs to the right of the vertical bar. If the expression on the left of the vertical bar is , as it is here, we describe the term as a _simple, scalar, random-effects term_. The designation “scalar” means there will be exactly one random effect generated for each level of the grouping factor. A simple, scalar term generates a block of indicator columns — the indicators for the grouping factor — in mathbf Z. Because there is only one random-effects term in this model and because that term is a simple, scalar term, the model matrix, 𝐙, for this model is the indicator matrix for the levels of Batch.In the next chapter we fit models with multiple simple, scalar terms and, in subsequent chapters, we extend random-effects terms beyond simple, scalar terms. When we have only simple, scalar terms in the model, each term has a unique grouping factor and the elements of the list returned by can be considered as associated with terms or with grouping factors. In more complex models a particular grouping factor may occur in more than one term, in which case the elements of the list are associated with the grouping factors, not the terms.Given the data, 𝐲, and the parameter estimates, we can evaluate a measure of the dispersion of (mathcal Bmathcal Y=mathbf y). In the case of a linear mixed model, this is the conditional standard deviation, from which we can obtain a prediction interval.

    "text": "A considerable amount of material has been presented in this chapter, especially considering the word “simple” in its title (it’s the model that is simple, not the material). A summary may be in order.A mixed-effects model incorporates fixed-effects parameters and random effects, which are unobserved random variables, mathcal B. In a linear mixed model, both the unconditional distribution of mathcal B and the conditional distribution, (mathcal Ymathcal B=mathbf b), are multivariate Gaussian distributions. Furthermore, this conditional distribution is a spherical Gaussian with mean, mathbfmu, determined by the linear predictor, mathbf Zmathbf b+mathbf Xmathbfbeta. That is,\\begin{equation}(\\mathcal Y|\\mathcal B=\\mathbf b)\\sim   \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf Z\\mathbf b+\\mathbf X\\mathbf\\beta, \\sigma^2\\mathbf I_n) .\\end{equation}The unconditional distribution of mathcal B has mean mathbf 0 and a parameterized qtimes q variance-covariance matrix, Sigma_theta.In the models we considered in this chapter, Sigma_theta, is a simple multiple of the identity matrix, mathbf I_6. This matrix is always a multiple of the identity in models with just one random-effects term that is a simple, scalar term. The reason for introducing all the machinery that we did is to allow for more general model specifications.The maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters are obtained by minimizing the deviance. For linear mixed models we can minimize the profiled deviance, which is a function of mathbftheta only, thereby considerably simplifying the optimization problem.To assess the precision of the parameter estimates, we profile the deviance function with respect to each parameter and apply a signed square root transformation to the likelihood ratio test statistic, producing a profile zeta function for each parameter. These functions provide likelihood-based confidence intervals for the parameters. Profile zeta plots allow us to visually assess the precision of individual parameters. Density plots derived from the profile zeta function provide another way of examining the distribution of the estimators of the parameters.Prediction intervals from the conditional distribution of the random effects, given the observed data, allow us to assess the precision of the random effects."

    "text": "One of the areas in which the methods in the package for are particularly effective is in fitting models to cross-classified data where several factors have random effects associated with them. For example, in many experiments in psychology the reaction of each of a group of subjects to each of a group of stimuli or items is measured. If the subjects are considered to be a sample from a population of subjects and the items are a sample from a population of items, then it would make sense to associate random effects with both these factors.In the past it was difficult to fit mixed models with multiple, crossed grouping factors to large, possibly unbalanced, data sets. The methods in the package are able to do this. To introduce the methods let us first consider a small, balanced data set with crossed grouping factors."

    "text": "The data are derived from Table 6.6, p. 144 of Davies (), where they are described as coming from an investigation toassess the variability between samples of penicillin by the B. subtilis method. In this test method a bulk-innoculated nutrient agar medium is poured into a Petri dish of approximately 90 mm. diameter, known as a plate. When the medium has set, six small hollow cylinders or pots (about 4 mm. in diameter) are cemented onto the surface at equally spaced intervals. A few drops of the penicillin solutions to be compared are placed in the respective cylinders, and the whole plate is placed in an incubator for a given time. Penicillin diffuses from the pots into the agar, and this produces a clear circular zone of inhibition of growth of the organisms, which can be readily measured. The diameter of the zone is related in a known way to the concentration of penicillin in the solution.julia> names(dat[:Penicillin])\n3-element Array{Symbol,1}:\n :Y\n :G\n :H\nof the data, then plot itThe variation in the diameter is associated with the plates and with the samples. Because each plate is used only for the six samples shown here we are not interested in the contributions of specific plates as much as we are interested in the variation due to plates and in assessing the potency of the samples after accounting for this variation. Thus, we will use random effects for the factor. We will also use random effects for the factor because, as in the Dyestuff example, we are more interested in the sample-to-sample variability in the penicillin samples than in the potency of a particular sample.In this experiment each sample is used on each plate. We say that the and factors are crossed, as opposed to nested factors, which we will describe in the next section. By itself, the designation “crossed” just means that the factors are not nested. If we wish to be more specific, we could describe these factors as being completely crossed, which means that we have at least one observation for each combination of a level of G and a level of H. We can see this in Fig. [fig:Penicillindot] and, because there are moderate numbers of levels in these factors, we can check it in a cross-tabulationjulia> freqtable(dat[:Penicillin][:H], dat[:Penicillin][:G])\n6×24 Named Array{Int64,2}\nDim1 ╲ Dim2 │ a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  j  …  o  p  q  r  s  t  u  v  w  x\n────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nA           │ 1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  …  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1\nB           │ 1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1     1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1\nC           │ 1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1     1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1\nD           │ 1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1     1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1\nE           │ 1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1     1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1\nF           │ 1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  …  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1\nLike the Dyestuff data, the factors in the Penicillin data are balanced. That is, there are exactly the same number of observations on each plate and for each sample and, furthermore, there is the same number of observations on each combination of levels. In this case there is exactly one observation for each combination of G, the plate, and H, the sample. We would describe the configuration of these two factors as an unreplicated, completely balanced, crossed design.In general, balance is a desirable but precarious property of a data set. We may be able to impose balance in a designed experiment but we typically cannot expect that data from an observation study will be balanced. Also, as anyone who analyzes real data soon finds out, expecting that balance in the design of an experiment will produce a balanced data set is contrary to “Murphy’s Law”. That’s why statisticians allow for missing data. Even when we apply each of the six samples to each of the 24 plates, something could go wrong for one of the samples on one of the plates, leaving us without a measurement for that combination of levels and thus an unbalanced data set."

These conclusions are consistent with what we see in the data plot (Fig. [fig:Penicillindot]).The prediction intervals on the random effects (Fig. [fig:fm03ranef])confirm that the conditional distribution of the random effects for has much less variability than does the conditional distribution of the random effects for , in the sense that the dots in the bottom panel have less variability than those in the top panel. (Note the different horizontal axes for the two panels.) However, the conditional distribution of the random effect for a particular , say sample F, has less variability than the conditional distribution of the random effect for a particular plate, say plate m. That is, the lines in the bottom panel are wider than the lines in the top panel, even after taking the different axis scales into account. This is because the conditional distribution of the random effect for a particular sample depends on 24 responses while the conditional distribution of the random effect for a particular plate depends on only 6 responses.In chapter [chap:ExamLMM] we saw that a model with a single, simple, scalar random-effects term generated a random-effects model matrix, mathbf Z, that is the matrix of indicators of the levels of the grouping factor. When we have multiple, simple, scalar random-effects terms, as in model , each term generates a matrix of indicator columns and these sets of indicators are concatenated to form the model matrix mathbf Z. The transpose of this matrix, shown in Fig. [fig:fm03Ztimage], contains rows of indicators for each factor.The relative covariance factor, Lambda_theta, (Fig. [fig:fm03LambdaLimage], left panel) is no longer a multiple of the identity. It is now block diagonal, with two blocks, one of size 24 and one of size 6, each of which is a multiple of the identity. The diagonal elements of the two blocks are theta_1 and theta_2, respectively. The numeric values of these parameters can be obtained asjulia> show(getθ(penm))\n[1.53758, 3.21975]or as the Final parameter vector in the opsum field of penmjulia> penm.optsum\nInitial parameter vector: [1.0, 1.0]\nInitial objective value:  364.6267798165791\n\nOptimizer (from NLopt):   LN_BOBYQA\nLower bounds:             [0.0, 0.0]\nftol_rel:                 1.0e-12\nftol_abs:                 1.0e-8\nxtol_rel:                 0.0\nxtol_abs:                 [1.0e-10, 1.0e-10]\ninitial_step:             [0.75, 0.75]\nmaxfeval:                 -1\n\nFunction evaluations:     44\nFinal parameter vector:   [1.53758, 3.21975]\nFinal objective value:    332.1883486722809\nReturn code:              FTOL_REACHED\n\nThe first parameter is the relative standard deviation of the random effects for plate, which has the value 0.8455646/0.5499331 = 1.53758 at convergence, and the second is the relative standard deviation of the random effects for sample (1.7706475/0.5499331 = 3.21975).Because Lambda_theta is diagonal, the pattern of non-zeros in Lambda_thetamathbf Zmathbf ZLambda_theta+mathbf I will be the same as that in mathbf Zmathbf Z, shown in the middle panel of Fig. [fig:fm03LambdaLimage]. The sparse Cholesky factor, mathbf L, shown in the right panel, is lower triangular and has non-zero elements in the lower right hand corner in positions where mathbf Zmathbf Z has systematic zeros. We say that “fill-in” has occurred when forming the sparse Cholesky decomposition. In this case there is a relatively minor amount of fill but in other cases there can be a substantial amount of fill and we shall take precautions so as to reduce this, because fill-in adds to the computational effort in determining the MLEs or the REML estimates.A bootstrap simulation of the modeljulia> @time penmbstp = bootstrap(10000, penm);\n  9.382835 seconds (19.42 M allocations: 867.233 MiB, 4.28% gc time)\nprovides the density plots(Image: )(Image: )(Image: )julia> plot(penmbstp, x = :σ₂, density, xlabel(\"σ₂\"))\nPlot(...)\n(Image: )A profile zeta plot (Fig. [fig:fm03prplot]) for the parameters in model(Image: Profile zeta plot of the parameters in model .)[fig:fm03prplot]leads to conclusions similar to those from Fig. [fig:fm1prof] for model in the previous chapter. The fixed-effect parameter, beta_1, for the constant term has symmetric intervals and is over-dispersed relative to the normal distribution. The logarithm of sigma has a good normal approximation but the standard deviations of the random effects, sigma_1 and sigma_2, are skewed. The skewness for sigma_2 is worse than that for sigma_1, because the estimate of sigma_2 is less precise than that of sigma_1, in both absolute and relative senses. For an absolute comparison we compare the widths of the confidence intervals for these parameters.                     2.5 %     97.5 %\n    .sig01       0.6335658  1.1821040\n    .sig02       1.0957893  3.5562919\n    .sigma       0.4858454  0.6294535\n    (Intercept) 21.2666274 24.6778176In a relative comparison we examine the ratio of the endpoints of the interval divided by the estimate.\n               2.5 %   97.5 %\n    .sig01 0.7492746 1.397993\n    .sig02 0.6188634 2.008469The lack of precision in the estimate of sigma_2 is a consequence of only having 6 distinct levels of the factor. The factor, on the other hand, has 24 distinct levels. In general it is more difficult to estimate a measure of spread, such as the standard deviation, than to estimate a measure of location, such as a mean, especially when the number of levels of the factor is small. Six levels are about the minimum number required for obtaining sensible estimates of standard deviations for simple, scalar random effects terms.shows patterns similar to those in Fig. [fig:fm1profpair] for pairs of parameters in model fit to the data. On the zeta scale (panels below the diagonal) the profile traces are nearly straight and orthogonal with the exception of the trace of zeta(sigma_2) on zeta(beta_0) (the horizontal trace for the panel in the (42) position). The pattern of this trace is similar to the pattern of the trace of zeta(sigma_1) on zeta(beta_1) in Fig. [fig:fm1profpair]. Moving beta_0 from its estimate, widehatbeta_0, in either direction will increase the residual sum of squares. The increase in the residual variability is reflected in an increase of one or more of the dispersion parameters. The balanced experimental design results in a fixed estimate of sigma and the extra apparent variability must be incorporated into sigma_1 or sigma_2.Contours in panels of parameter pairs on the original scales (i.e. panels above the diagonal) can show considerable distortion from the ideal elliptical shape. For example, contours in the sigma_2 versus sigma_1 panel (the (12) position) and the log(sigma) versus sigma_2 panel (in the (23) position) are dramatically non-elliptical. However, the distortion of the contours is not due to these parameter estimates depending strongly on each other. It is almost entirely due to the choice of scale for sigma_1 and sigma_2. When we plot the contours on the scale of log(sigma_1) and log(sigma_2) instead (Fig. [fig:lpr03pairs])(Image: Profile pairs plot for the parameters in model fit to the data. In this plot the parameters $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$ are on the scale of the natural logarithm, as is the parameter $\\sigma$ in this and other profile pairs plots.)[fig:fm03lprpairs]they are much closer to the elliptical pattern.Conversely, if we tried to plot contours on the scale of sigma_1^2 and sigma_2^2 (not shown), they would be hideously distorted."

It is tempting to use the cask designation (‘a’, ‘b’ and ‘c’) to determine, say, the plotting symbol within a sample. It would be fine to do this within a batch but the plot would be misleading if we used the same symbol for cask ‘a’ in different batches. There is no relationship between cask ‘a’ in batch ‘A’ and cask ‘a’ in batch ‘B’. The labels ‘a’, ‘b’ and ‘c’ are used only to distinguish the three samples within a batch; they do not have a meaning across batches.(Image: Strength of paste preparations according to the and the within the batch. There were two strength measurements on each of the 30 samples; three samples each from 10 batches.)[fig:Pastesplot]In Fig. [fig:Pastesplot] we plot the two strength measurements on each of the samples within each of the batches and join up the average strength for each sample. The perceptive reader will have noticed that the levels of the factors on the vertical axis in this figure, and in Fig. [fig:Dyestuffdot] and [fig:Penicillindot], have been reordered according to increasing average response. In all these cases there is no inherent ordering of the levels of the covariate such as or . Rather than confuse our interpretation of the plot by determining the vertical displacement of points according to a random ordering, we impose an ordering according to increasing mean response. This allows us to more easily check for structure in the data, including undesirable characteristics like increasing variability of the response with increasing mean level of the response.In Fig. [fig:Pastesplot] we order the samples within each batch separately then order the batches according to increasing mean strength.Figure [fig:Pastesplot] shows considerable variability in strength between samples relative to the variability within samples. There is some indication of variability between batches, in addition to the variability induced by the samples, but not a strong indication of a batch effect. For example, batches I and D, with low mean strength relative to the other batches, each contained one sample (I:b and D:c, respectively) that had high mean strength relative to the other samples. Also, batches H and C, with comparatively high mean batch strength, contain samples H:a and C:a with comparatively low mean sample strength. In Sect. [sec:TestingSig2is0] we will examine the need for incorporating batch-to-batch variability, in addition to sample-to-sample variability, in the statistical model."

Some presentations of mixed-effects models, especially those related to multilevel modeling  or hierarchical linear models , leave the impression that one can only define random effects with respect to factors that are nested. This is the origin of the terms “multilevel”, referring to multiple, nested levels of variability, and “hierarchical”, also invoking the concept of a hierarchy of levels. To be fair, both those references do describe the use of models with random effects associated with non-nested factors, but such models tend to be treated as a special case.The blurring of mixed-effects models with the concept of multiple, hierarchical levels of variation results in an unwarranted emphasis on “levels” when defining a model and leads to considerable confusion. It is perfectly legitimate to define models having random effects associated with non-nested factors. The reasons for the emphasis on defining random effects with respect to nested factors only are that such cases do occur frequently in practice and that some of the computational methods for estimating the parameters in the models can only be easily applied to nested factors.This is not the case for the methods used in the package. Indeed there is nothing special done for models with random effects for nested factors. When random effects are associated with multiple factors exactly the same computational methods are used whether the factors form a nested sequence or are partially crossed or are completely crossed. There is, however, one aspect of nested grouping factors that we should emphasize, which is the possibility of a factor that is implicitly nested within another factor. Suppose, for example, that the factor was defined as having three levels instead of 30 with the implicit assumption that is nested within . It may seem silly to try to distinguish 30 different batches with only three levels of a factor but, unfortunately, data are frequently organized and presented like this, especially in text books. The factor in the data is exactly such an implicitly nested factor. If we cross-tabulate cask and batch        batch\n    cask A B C D E F G H I J\n       a 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n       b 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n       c 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2we get the impression that the and factors are crossed, not nested. If we know that the cask should be considered as nested within the batch then we should create a new categorical variable giving the batch-cask combination, which is exactly what the factor is. A simple way to create such a factor is to use the interaction operator, ‘’, on the factors. It is advisable, but not necessary, to apply to the result thereby dropping unused levels of the interaction from the set of all possible levels of the factor. (An “unused level” is a combination that does not occur in the data.) A convenient code idiom isorIn a small data set like we can quickly detect a factor being implicitly nested within another factor and take appropriate action. In a large data set, perhaps hundreds of thousands of test scores for students in thousands of schools from hundreds of school districts, it is not always obvious if school identifiers are unique across the entire data set or just within a district. If you are not sure, the safest thing to do is to create the interaction factor, as shown above, so you can be confident that levels of the district:school interaction do indeed correspond to unique schools."

    "text": "One of the many famous statements attributed to Albert Einstein is “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.” In statistical modeling this principal of parsimony is embodied in hypothesis tests comparing two models, one of which contains the other as a special case. Typically, one or more of the parameters in the more general model, which we call the alternative hypothesis, is constrained in some way, resulting in the restricted model, which we call the null hypothesis. Although we phrase the hypothesis test in terms of the parameter restriction, it is important to realize that we are comparing the quality of fits obtained with two nested models. That is, we are not assessing parameter values per se; we are comparing the model fit obtainable with some constraints on parameter values to that without the constraints.Because the more general model, H_a, must provide a fit that is at least as good as the restricted model, H_0, our purpose is to determine whether the change in the quality of the fit is sufficient to justify the greater complexity of model H_a. This comparison is often reduced to a p-value, which is the probability of seeing a difference in the model fits as large as we did, or even larger, when, in fact, H_0 is adequate. Like all probabilities, a p-value must be between 0 and 1. When the p-value for a test is small (close to zero) we prefer the more complex model, saying that we “reject H_0 in favor of H_a”. On the other hand, when the p-value is not small we “fail to reject H_0”, arguing that there is a non-negligible probability that the observed difference in the model fits could reasonably be the result of random chance, not the inherent superiority of the model H_a. Under these circumstances we prefer the simpler model, H_0, according to the principal of parsimony.These are the general principles of statistical hypothesis tests. To perform a test in practice we must specify the criterion for comparing the model fits, the method for calculating the p-value from an observed value of the criterion, and the standard by which we will determine if the p-value is “small” or not. The criterion is called the test statistic, the p-value is calculated from a reference distribution for the test statistic, and the standard for small p-values is called the level of the test.In Sect. [sec:variability] we referred to likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) for which the test statistic is the difference in the deviance. That is, the LRT statistic is d_0-d_a where d_a is the deviance in the more general (H_a) model fit and d_0 is the deviance in the constrained (H_0) model. An approximate reference distribution for an LRT statistic is the chi^2_nu distribution where nu, the degrees of freedom, is determined by the number of constraints imposed on the parameters of H_a to produce H_0.The restricted model fitjulia> pstsm1 = fit!(lmm(@formula(Y ~ 1 + (1|G)), dat[:Pastes]))\nLinear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood\n Formula: Y ~ 1 + (1 | G)\n   logLik   -2 logLik     AIC        BIC    \n -124.20085  248.40170  254.40170  260.68473\n\nVariance components:\n              Column    Variance  Std.Dev. \n G        (Intercept)  9.6328208 3.1036786\n Residual              0.6780001 0.8234076\n Number of obs: 60; levels of grouping factors: 30\n\n  Fixed-effects parameters:\n             Estimate Std.Error z value P(>|z|)\n(Intercept)   60.0533  0.576536 104.162  <1e-99\n\nis compared to model pstsm withjulia> MixedModels.lrt(pstsm1, pstsm)\n2×4 DataFrames.DataFrame\n│ Row │ Df │ Deviance │ Chisq    │ pval     │\n├─────┼────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┤\n│ 1   │ 3  │ 248.402  │ NaN      │ NaN      │\n│ 2   │ 4  │ 247.994  │ 0.407234 │ 0.523377 │\nwhich provides a p-value of 05234. Because typical standards for “small” p-values are 5% or 1%, a p-value over 50% would not be considered significant at any reasonable level.We do need to be cautious in quoting this p-value, however, because the parameter value being tested, sigma_2=0, is on the boundary of set of possible values, sigma_2ge 0, for this parameter. The argument for using a chi^2_1 distribution to calculate a p-value for the change in the deviance does not apply when the parameter value being tested is on the boundary. As shown in Pinheiro and Bates (2000), the p-value from the chi^2_1 distribution will be “conservative” in the sense that it is larger than a simulation-based p-value would be. In the worst-case scenario the chi^2-based p-value will be twice as large as it should be but, even if that were true, an effective p-value of 26% would not cause us to reject H_0 in favor of H_a."

We describe such situations as having partially crossed grouping factors for the random effects.Studies in education, in which test scores for students over time are also associated with teachers and schools, usually result in partially crossed grouping factors. If students with scores in multiple years have different teachers for the different years, the student factor cannot be nested within the teacher factor. Conversely, student and teacher factors are not expected to be completely crossed. To have complete crossing of the student and teacher factors it would be necessary for each student to be observed with each teacher, which would be unusual. A longitudinal study of thousands of students with hundreds of different teachers inevitably ends up partially crossed.In this section we consider an example with thousands of students and instructors where the response is the student’s evaluation of the instructor’s effectiveness. These data, like those from most large observational studies, are quite unbalanced."

When a model is fit to a very large sample even the most subtle of differences can be highly “statistically significant”. The researcher or data analyst must then decide if these terms have practical significance, beyond the apparent statistical significance.The large sample size also helps to assure that the parameters have good normal approximations. We could profile this model fit but doing so would take a very long time and, in this particular case, the analysts are more interested in a model that uses fixed-effects parameters for the instructors, which we will describe in the next chapter.We could pursue other mixed-effects models here, such as using the factor and not the interaction to define random effects, but we will revisit these data in the next chapter and follow up on some of these variations there.(Image: Image of the sparse Cholesky factor, $\\mathbf L$, from model )[fig:fm05Limage]"

    "text": "A simple, scalar random effects term in an model formula is of the form , where is an expression whose value is the grouping factor of the set of random effects generated by this term. Typically, is simply the name of a factor, such as in the terms or in the examples in this chapter. However, the grouping factor can be the value of an expression, such as in the last example.Because simple, scalar random-effects terms can differ only in the description of the grouping factor we refer to configurations such as crossed or nested as applying to the terms or to the random effects, although it is more accurate to refer to the configuration as applying to the grouping factors.A model formula can include several such random effects terms. Because configurations such as nested or crossed or partially crossed grouping factors are a property of the data, the specification in the model formula does not depend on the configuration. We simply include multiple random effects terms in the formula specifying the model.One apparent exception to this rule occurs with implicitly nested factors, in which the levels of one factor are only meaningful within a particular level of the other factor. In the data, levels of the factor are only meaningful within a particular level of the factor. A model formula ofstrength ~ 1 + (1 | cask) + (1 | batch)would result in a fitted model that did not appropriately reflect the sources of variability in the data. Following the simple rule that the factor should be defined so that distinct experimental or observational units correspond to distinct levels of the factor will avoid such ambiguity.For convenience, a model with multiple, nested random-effects terms can be specified asstrength ~ 1 + (1 | batch/cask)which internally is re-expressed asstrength ~ 1 + (1 | batch) + (1 | batch:cask)We will avoid terms of the form , preferring instead an explicit specification with simple, scalar terms based on unambiguous grouping factors.The data, described in Sec. [sec:InstEval], illustrate some of the characteristics of the real data to which mixed-effects models are now fit. There is a large number of observations associated with several grouping factors; two of which, student and instructor, have a large number of levels and are partially crossed. Such data are common in sociological and educational studies but until now it has been very difficult to fit models that appropriately reflect such a structure. Much of the literature on mixed-effects models leaves the impression that multiple random effects terms can only be associated with nested grouping factors. The resulting emphasis on hierarchical or multilevel configurations is an artifact of the computational methods used to fit the models, not the models themselves.The parameters of the models fit to small data sets have properties similar to those for the models in the previous chapter. That is, profile-based confidence intervals on the fixed-effects parameter, beta_0, are symmetric about the estimate but overdispersed relative to those that would be calculated from a normal distribution and the logarithm of the residual standard deviation, log(sigma), has a good normal approximation. Profile-based confidence intervals for the standard deviations of random effects (sigma_1, sigma_2, etc.) are symmetric on a logarithmic scale except for those that could be zero.Another observation from the last example is that, for data sets with a very large numbers of observations, a term in a model may be “statistically significant” even when its practical significance is questionable."

Indeed, a great deal of effort went into creating this form so that the profiled log-likelihood can be easily evaluated and so that the constraints on the parameters, theta, are simple \"box\" constraints. In fact, the constraints are simple lower bounds.julia> show(lowerbd(sleepm))\n[0.0, -Inf, 0.0]In contrast, trying to optimize the log-likelihood with respect to standard deviations and correlations of the random effects would be quite difficult because the constraints on the correlations when the covariance matrix is larger than 2times 2 are quite complicated. Also, the correlation itself can be unstable. Consider what happens to the expression for the correlation if both Lambda_21 and Lambda_22 are small in magnitude. Small perturbations in Lambda_21 that result in sign changes can move the correlation from near -1 to near +1 or vice-versa.Some details on the optimization process are available in an OptSummary object stored as the optsum field of the model.julia> sleepm.optsum\nInitial parameter vector: [1.0, 0.0, 1.0]\nInitial objective value:  1784.6422961924686\n\nOptimizer (from NLopt):   LN_BOBYQA\nLower bounds:             [0.0, -Inf, 0.0]\nftol_rel:                 1.0e-12\nftol_abs:                 1.0e-8\nxtol_rel:                 0.0\nxtol_abs:                 [1.0e-10, 1.0e-10, 1.0e-10]\ninitial_step:             [0.75, 1.0, 0.75]\nmaxfeval:                 -1\n\nFunction evaluations:     57\nFinal parameter vector:   [0.929221, 0.0181684, 0.222645]\nFinal objective value:    1751.9393444647078\nReturn code:              FTOL_REACHED\n\n"

    "category": "section",
    "text": "Determining if an estimated covariance matrix is singular is easy when using the theta  parameters because singularity corresponds to points on the boundary of the allowable parameter space. In other words, if the optimization converges to a vector in which either or both of theta_1 or theta_3 are zero, the covariance matrix is singular. Otherwise it is non-singular.The theta_1 parameter is the estimated relative standard deviation of the random intercepts. If this is zero then the correlation is undefined and reported as NaN. If theta_3 is zero and theta_2 is non-zero then the estimated correlation is pm 1 with the sign determined by the sign of theta_2. If both theta_2 and theta_3 are zero the correlation is NaN because the standard deviation of the random slopes will be zero.Singular covariance matrices larger than 2times 2 do not necessarily result in particular values, like ±1, for the correlations.Users of lmer or lmm are sometimes taken aback by convergence on the boundary if this produces correlations of NaN or pm 1. Some feel that this is a sign of model failure. Others consider such estimates as a sign that Bayesian methods with priors that pull singular covariance matrices away from the boundary should be used.This type of value judgement seems peculiar. An important property of maximum likelihood estimates is that these estimates are well-defined once the probability model for the data has been specified. It may be difficult to determine numerical values of the estimates but the definition itself is straightforward. If there is a direct method of evaluating the log-likelihood at a particular value of the parameters, then, by definition, the mle\'s are the parameter values that maximize this log-likelihood. Bates et al. (2015) provide such a method of evaluating the log-likelihood for a linear mixed-effects model. Indeed they go further and describe how the fixed-effects parameters and one of the variance components can be profiled out of the log-likelihood evaluation, thereby reducing the dimension of the nonlinear, constrained optimization problem to be solved.If the mle\'s correspond to a singular covariance matrix, this is a property of the model and the data. It is not a mistake in some way. It is just the way things are. It reflects the fact that often the distribution of the estimator of a covariance matrix is diffuse. It is difficult to estimate variances and covariances precisely. A search for papers or books on \"covariance estimation\" will produce many results, often describing ways of regularizing the estimating process because the data themselves do not provide precise estimates.For the example at hand a parametric bootstrap is one way of evaluating the precision of the estimates."

A histogram of the estimated correlations of the random effects is dominated by the boundary values.(Image: )Even though the estimated correlation in the model is -0.30, more of the boundary values are at +1 than at -1. This may be an artifact of the optimization routine used. In some cases there may be multiple optima on the boundary. It is difficult to determine the global optimum in these cases.A histogram of the reciprocal condition number is also dominated by the boundary values."
