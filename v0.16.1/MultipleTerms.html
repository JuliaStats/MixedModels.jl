For example, in many experiments in psychology the reaction of each of a group of subjects to each of a group of stimuli or items is measured. If the subjects are considered to be a sample from a population of subjects and the items are a sample from a population of items, then it would make sense to associate random effects with both these factors.</p><p>In the past it was difficult to fit mixed models with multiple, crossed grouping factors to large, possibly unbalanced, data sets. The methods in the package are able to do this. To introduce the methods let us first consider a small, balanced data set with crossed grouping factors.</p><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="The-Penicillin-Data-1" href="#The-Penicillin-Data-1">The <code>Penicillin</code> Data</a></h3><p>The data are derived from Table 6.6, p. 144 of Davies (), where they are described as coming from an investigation to</p><blockquote><p>assess the variability between samples of penicillin by the <em>B. subtilis</em> method. In this test method a bulk-innoculated nutrient agar medium is poured into a Petri dish of approximately 90 mm. diameter, known as a plate. When the medium has set, six small hollow cylinders or pots (about 4 mm. in diameter) are cemented onto the surface at equally spaced intervals. A few drops of the penicillin solutions to be compared are placed in the respective cylinders, and the whole plate is placed in an incubator for a given time. Penicillin diffuses from the pots into the agar, and this produces a clear circular zone of inhibition of growth of the organisms, which can be readily measured. The diameter of the zone is related in a known way to the concentration of penicillin in the solution.</p></blockquote><pre><code class="language-julia">julia&gt; names(dat[:Penicillin])

</code></pre><p>of the data, then plot it</p><p>The variation in the diameter is associated with the plates and with the samples. Because each plate is used only for the six samples shown here we are not interested in the contributions of specific plates as much as we are interested in the variation due to plates and in assessing the potency of the samples after accounting for this variation. Thus, we will use random effects for the factor. We will also use random effects for the factor because, as in the <code>Dyestuff</code> example, we are more interested in the sample-to-sample variability in the penicillin samples than in the potency of a particular sample.</p><p>In this experiment each sample is used on each plate. We say that the and factors are <em>crossed</em>, as opposed to <em>nested</em> factors, which we will describe in the next section. By itself, the designation “crossed” just means that the factors are not nested. If we wish to be more specific, we could describe these factors as being <em>completely crossed</em>, which means that we have at least one observation for each combination of a level of <code>G</code> and a level of <code>H</code>. We can see this in Fig. [fig:Penicillindot] and, because there are moderate numbers of levels in these factors, we can check it in a cross-tabulation</p><pre><code class="language-julia">julia&gt; freqtable(dat[:Penicillin][:H], dat[:Penicillin][:G])

</code></pre><p>Like the <code>Dyestuff</code> data, the factors in the <code>Penicillin</code> data are balanced. That is, there are exactly the same number of observations on each plate and for each sample and, furthermore, there is the same number of observations on each combination of levels. In this case there is exactly one observation for each combination of <code>G</code>, the plate, and <code>H</code>, the sample. We would describe the configuration of these two factors as an unreplicated, completely balanced, crossed design.</p><p>In general, balance is a desirable but precarious property of a data set. We may be able to impose balance in a designed experiment but we typically cannot expect that data from an observation study will be balanced. Also, as anyone who analyzes real data soon finds out, expecting that balance in the design of an experiment will produce a balanced data set is contrary to “Murphy’s Law”. That’s why statisticians allow for missing data. Even when we apply each of the six samples to each of the 24 plates, something could go wrong for one of the samples on one of the plates, leaving us without a measurement for that combination of levels and thus an unbalanced data set.</p><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="A-Model-For-the-Penicillin-Data-1" href="#A-Model-For-the-Penicillin-Data-1">A Model For the <code>Penicillin</code> Data</a></h3><p>A model incorporating random effects for both the plate and the sample is straightforward to specify — we include simple, scalar random effects terms for both these factors.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">julia&gt; penm = fit!(lmm(@formula(Y ~ 1 + (1|G) + (1|H)), dat[:Penicillin]))

</code></pre><p>This model display indicates that the sample-to-sample variability has the greatest contribution, then plate-to-plate variability and finally the “residual” variability that cannot be attributed to either the sample or the plate. These conclusions are consistent with what we see in the data plot (Fig. [fig:Penicillindot]).</p><p>The prediction intervals on the random effects (Fig. [fig:fm03ranef])</p><p>confirm that the conditional distribution of the random effects for has much less variability than does the conditional distribution of the random effects for , in the sense that the dots in the bottom panel have less variability than those in the top panel. (Note the different horizontal axes for the two panels.) However, the conditional distribution of the random effect for a particular , say sample F, has less variability than the conditional distribution of the random effect for a particular plate, say plate m. That is, the lines in the bottom panel are wider than the lines in the top panel, even after taking the different axis scales into account. This is because the conditional distribution of the random effect for a particular sample depends on 24 responses while the conditional distribution of the random effect for a particular plate depends on only 6 responses.</p><p>In chapter [chap:ExamLMM] we saw that a model with a single, simple, scalar random-effects term generated a random-effects model matrix, <span>$\mathbf Z$</span>, that is the matrix of indicators of the levels of the grouping factor. When we have multiple, simple, scalar random-effects terms, as in model , each term generates a matrix of indicator columns and these sets of indicators are concatenated to form the model matrix <span>$\mathbf Z$</span>. The transpose of this matrix, shown in Fig. [fig:fm03Ztimage], contains rows of indicators for each factor.</p><p>The relative covariance factor, <span>$\Lambda_\theta$</span>, (Fig. [fig:fm03LambdaLimage], left panel) is no longer a multiple of the identity.

The pattern of this trace is similar to the pattern of the trace of <span>$\zeta(\sigma_1)$</span> on <span>$\zeta(\beta_1)$</span> in Fig. [fig:fm1profpair]. Moving <span>$\beta_0$</span> from its estimate, <span>$\widehat{\beta}_0$</span>, in either direction will increase the residual sum of squares. The increase in the residual variability is reflected in an increase of one or more of the dispersion parameters.

However, the distortion of the contours is not due to these parameter estimates depending strongly on each other.

There were two strength measurements on each of the 30 samples; three samples each from 10 batches."/></p><p>[fig:Pastesplot]</p><p>In Fig. [fig:Pastesplot] we plot the two strength measurements on each of the samples within each of the batches and join up the average strength for each sample. The perceptive reader will have noticed that the levels of the factors on the vertical axis in this figure, and in Fig. [fig:Dyestuffdot] and [fig:Penicillindot], have been reordered according to increasing average response. In all these cases there is no inherent ordering of the levels of the covariate such as or . Rather than confuse our interpretation of the plot by determining the vertical displacement of points according to a random ordering, we impose an ordering according to increasing mean response. This allows us to more easily check for structure in the data, including undesirable characteristics like increasing variability of the response with increasing mean level of the response.</p><p>In Fig. [fig:Pastesplot] we order the samples within each batch separately then order the batches according to increasing mean strength.</p><p>Figure [fig:Pastesplot] shows considerable variability in strength between samples relative to the variability within samples. There is some indication of variability between batches, in addition to the variability induced by the samples, but not a strong indication of a batch effect. For example, batches I and D, with low mean strength relative to the other batches, each contained one sample (I:b and D:c, respectively) that had high mean strength relative to the other samples. Also, batches H and C, with comparatively high mean batch strength, contain samples H:a and C:a with comparatively low mean sample strength. In Sect. [sec:TestingSig2is0] we will examine the need for incorporating batch-to-batch variability, in addition to sample-to-sample variability, in the statistical model.</p><h4><a class="nav-anchor" id="Nested-Factors-1" href="#Nested-Factors-1">Nested Factors</a></h4><p>Because each level of occurs with one and only one level of we say that is <em>nested within</em> . Some presentations of mixed-effects models, especially those related to <em>multilevel modeling</em>  or <em>hierarchical linear models</em> , leave the impression that one can only define random effects with respect to factors that are nested. This is the origin of the terms “multilevel”, referring to multiple, nested levels of variability, and “hierarchical”, also invoking the concept of a hierarchy of levels. To be fair, both those references do describe the use of models with random effects associated with non-nested factors, but such models tend to be treated as a special case.</p><p>The blurring of mixed-effects models with the concept of multiple, hierarchical levels of variation results in an unwarranted emphasis on “levels” when defining a model and leads to considerable confusion. It is perfectly legitimate to define models having random effects associated with non-nested factors. The reasons for the emphasis on defining random effects with respect to nested factors only are that such cases do occur frequently in practice and that some of the computational methods for estimating the parameters in the models can only be easily applied to nested factors.</p><p>This is not the case for the methods used in the package. Indeed there is nothing special done for models with random effects for nested factors. When random effects are associated with multiple factors exactly the same computational methods are used whether the factors form a nested sequence or are partially crossed or are completely crossed. There is, however, one aspect of nested grouping factors that we should emphasize, which is the possibility of a factor that is <em>implicitly nested</em> within another factor. Suppose, for example, that the factor was defined as having three levels instead of 30 with the implicit assumption that is nested within . It may seem silly to try to distinguish 30 different batches with only three levels of a factor but, unfortunately, data are frequently organized and presented like this, especially in text books. The factor in the data is exactly such an implicitly nested factor. If we cross-tabulate <code>cask</code> and <code>batch</code></p><pre><code class="language-none">        batch
    cask A B C D E F G H I J
       a 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
       b 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
       c 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2</code></pre><p>we get the impression that the and factors are crossed, not nested. If we know that the cask should be considered as nested within the batch then we should create a new categorical variable giving the batch-cask combination, which is exactly what the factor is. A simple way to create such a factor is to use the interaction operator, ‘’, on the factors. It is advisable, but not necessary, to apply to the result thereby dropping unused levels of the interaction from the set of all possible levels of the factor. (An “unused level” is a combination that does not occur in the data.) A convenient code idiom is</p><p>or</p><p>In a small data set like we can quickly detect a factor being implicitly nested within another factor and take appropriate action. In a large data set, perhaps hundreds of thousands of test scores for students in thousands of schools from hundreds of school districts, it is not always obvious if school identifiers are unique across the entire data set or just within a district. If you are not sure, the safest thing to do is to create the interaction factor, as shown above, so you can be confident that levels of the district:school interaction do indeed correspond to unique schools.</p><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="Fitting-a-Model-With-Nested-Random-Effects-1" href="#Fitting-a-Model-With-Nested-Random-Effects-1">Fitting a Model With Nested Random Effects</a></h3><p>Fitting a model with simple, scalar random effects for nested factors is done in exactly the same way as fitting a model with random effects for crossed grouping factors.

Typically, one or more of the parameters in the more general model, which we call the <em>alternative hypothesis</em>, is constrained in some way, resulting in the restricted model, which we call the <em>null hypothesis</em>. Although we phrase the hypothesis test in terms of the parameter restriction, it is important to realize that we are comparing the quality of fits obtained with two nested models. That is, we are not assessing parameter values per se; we are comparing the model fit obtainable with some constraints on parameter values to that without the constraints.</p><p>Because the more general model, <span>$H_a$</span>, must provide a fit that is at least as good as the restricted model, <span>$H_0$</span>, our purpose is to determine whether the change in the quality of the fit is sufficient to justify the greater complexity of model <span>$H_a$</span>. This comparison is often reduced to a <em>p-value</em>, which is the probability of seeing a difference in the model fits as large as we did, or even larger, when, in fact, <span>$H_0$</span> is adequate. Like all probabilities, a p-value must be between 0 and 1. When the p-value for a test is small (close to zero) we prefer the more complex model, saying that we “reject <span>$H_0$</span> in favor of <span>$H_a$</span>”. On the other hand, when the p-value is not small we “fail to reject <span>$H_0$</span>”, arguing that there is a non-negligible probability that the observed difference in the model fits could reasonably be the result of random chance, not the inherent superiority of the model <span>$H_a$</span>. Under these circumstances we prefer the simpler model, <span>$H_0$</span>, according to the principal of parsimony.</p><p>These are the general principles of statistical hypothesis tests. To perform a test in practice we must specify the criterion for comparing the model fits, the method for calculating the p-value from an observed value of the criterion, and the standard by which we will determine if the p-value is “small” or not. The criterion is called the <em>test statistic</em>, the p-value is calculated from a <em>reference distribution</em> for the test statistic, and the standard for small p-values is called the <em>level</em> of the test.</p><p>In Sect. [sec:variability] we referred to likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) for which the test statistic is the difference in the deviance. That is, the LRT statistic is <span>$d_0-d_a$</span> where <span>$d_a$</span> is the deviance in the more general (<span>$H_a$</span>) model fit and <span>$d_0$</span> is the deviance in the constrained (<span>$H_0$</span>) model. An approximate reference distribution for an LRT statistic is the <span>$\chi^2_\nu$</span> distribution where <span>$\nu$</span>, the degrees of freedom, is determined by the number of constraints imposed on the parameters of <span>$H_a$</span> to produce <span>$H_0$</span>.</p><p>The restricted model fit</p><pre><code class="language-julia">julia&gt; pstsm1 = fit!(lmm(@formula(Y ~ 1 + (1|G)), dat[:Pastes]))

We could profile this model fit but doing so would take a very long time and, in this particular case, the analysts are more interested in a model that uses fixed-effects parameters for the instructors, which we will describe in the next chapter.</p><p>We could pursue other mixed-effects models here, such as using the factor and not the interaction to define random effects, but we will revisit these data in the next chapter and follow up on some of these variations there.</p><p><img src="figure/Multiple-fm05Limage" alt="Image of the sparse Cholesky factor, \$\\mathbf L\$, from model "/></p><p>[fig:fm05Limage]</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Chapter-Summary-1" href="#Chapter-Summary-1">Chapter Summary</a></h2><p>A simple, scalar random effects term in an model formula is of the form , where is an expression whose value is the <em>grouping factor</em> of the set of random effects generated by this term. Typically, is simply the name of a factor, such as in the terms or in the examples in this chapter. However, the grouping factor can be the value of an expression, such as in the last example.</p><p>Because simple, scalar random-effects terms can differ only in the description of the grouping factor we refer to configurations such as crossed or nested as applying to the terms or to the random effects, although it is more accurate to refer to the configuration as applying to the grouping factors.</p><p>A model formula can include several such random effects terms. Because configurations such as nested or crossed or partially crossed grouping factors are a property of the data, the specification in the model formula does not depend on the configuration. We simply include multiple random effects terms in the formula specifying the model.</p><p>One apparent exception to this rule occurs with implicitly nested factors, in which the levels of one factor are only meaningful within a particular level of the other factor. In the data, levels of the factor are only meaningful within a particular level of the factor. A model formula of</p><pre><code class="language-none">strength ~ 1 + (1 | cask) + (1 | batch)</code></pre><p>would result in a fitted model that did not appropriately reflect the sources of variability in the data. Following the simple rule that the factor should be defined so that distinct experimental or observational units correspond to distinct levels of the factor will avoid such ambiguity.</p><p>For convenience, a model with multiple, nested random-effects terms can be specified as</p><pre><code class="language-none">strength ~ 1 + (1 | batch/cask)</code></pre><p>which internally is re-expressed as</p><pre><code class="language-none">strength ~ 1 + (1 | batch) + (1 | batch:cask)</code></pre><p>We will avoid terms of the form , preferring instead an explicit specification with simple, scalar terms based on unambiguous grouping factors.</p><p>The data, described in Sec. [sec:InstEval], illustrate some of the characteristics of the real data to which mixed-effects models are now fit. There is a large number of observations associated with several grouping factors; two of which, student and instructor, have a large number of levels and are partially crossed. Such data are common in sociological and educational studies but until now it has been very difficult to fit models that appropriately reflect such a structure. Much of the literature on mixed-effects models leaves the impression that multiple random effects terms can only be associated with nested grouping factors. The resulting emphasis on hierarchical or multilevel configurations is an artifact of the computational methods used to fit the models, not the models themselves.</p><p>The parameters of the models fit to small data sets have properties similar to those for the models in the previous chapter. That is, profile-based confidence intervals on the fixed-effects parameter, <span>$\beta_0$</span>, are symmetric about the estimate but overdispersed relative to those that would be calculated from a normal distribution and the logarithm of the residual standard deviation, <span>$\log(\sigma)$</span>, has a good normal approximation. Profile-based confidence intervals for the standard deviations of random effects (<span>$\sigma_1$</span>, <span>$\sigma_2$</span>, etc.) are symmetric on a logarithmic scale except for those that could be zero.</p><p>Another observation from the last example is that, for data sets with a very large numbers of observations, a term in a model may be “statistically significant” even when its practical significance is questionable.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Exercises-1" href="#Exercises-1">Exercises</a></h2><p>These exercises use data sets from the package for .
