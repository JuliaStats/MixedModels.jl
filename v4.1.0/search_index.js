Each side specifies at a high level how tabular data is to be converted to a numerical matrix suitable for modeling.  This specification looks something like Julia code, is represented as a Julia Expr, but uses special syntax.  The @formula macro takes an expression like y ~ 1 + a*b, transforms it according to the formula syntax rules into a lowered form (like y ~ 1 + a + b + a&b), and constructs a Formula struct which captures the original expression, the lowered expression, and the left- and right-hand-side.\n\nOperators that have special interpretations in this syntax are\n\n~ is the formula separator, where it is a binary operator (the first argument is the left-hand side, and the second is the right-hand side.\n+ concatenates variables as columns when generating a model matrix.\n& representes an interaction between two or more variables, which corresponds to a row-wise kronecker product of the individual terms (or element-wise product if all terms involved are continuous/scalar).\n* expands to all main effects and interactions: a*b is equivalent to a+b+a&b, a*b*c to a+b+c+a&b+a&c+b&c+a&b&c, etc.\n1, 0, and -1 indicate the presence (for 1) or absence (for 0 and -1) of an intercept column.\n\nThe rules that are applied are\n\nThe associative rule (un-nests nested calls to +, &, and *).\nThe distributive rule (interactions & distribute over concatenation +).\nThe * rule expands a*b to a+b+a&b (recursively).\nSubtraction is converted to addition and negation, so x-1 becomes x + -1 (applies only to subtraction of literal 1).\nSingle-argument & calls are stripped, so &(x) becomes the main effect x.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"macro"},{"location":"constructors/","page":"Model constructors","title":"Model constructors","text":"The second way is to combine Terms with operators like +, &, ~, and others at \"run time\".

Clearly, the rank can never be more than the number of columns; however, the rank can be less than the number of columns. In a regression context, this corresponds to a (linear) dependency in the predictors. The simplest case of rank deficiency is a duplicated predictor or a predictor that is exactly a multiple of another predictor. However, rank deficiency can also arise in more subtle ways, such as from missing cells in a two-factor experimental design. Rank deficiency can also arise as an extreme case of multicollinearity. In all cases, it is important to remember that we can only assess the numerical rank of a matrix, which may be less than its theoretical rank, and that evaluation of this numerical rank requires setting some numerical tolerance levels. These choices are not always well defined.

Note however, that the redundant column is not defined uniquely. For example, in the case that of two columns a and b where b = 2a, then the rank deficiency can be handled by eliminating either a or b. While we defined b here in terms of a, it may be that b is actually the more 'fundamental' predictor and hence we may define  a in terms of b as a = 0.5b.

In practice the determination of rank and the redundant coefficients is done via a 'pivoting' scheme during a decomposition to move the surplus columns to the right side of the model matrix.
