Clearly, the rank can never be more than the number of columns; however, the rank can be less than the number of columns. In a regression context, this corresponds to a (linear) dependency in the predictors. The simplest case of rank deficiency is a duplicated predictor or a predictor that is exactly a multiple of another predictor. However, rank deficiency can also arise in more subtle ways, such as from missing cells in a two-factor experimental design. Rank deficiency can also arise as an extreme case of multicollinearity. In all cases, it is important to remember that we can only assess the numerical rank of a matrix, which may be less than its theoretical rank, and that evaluation of this numerical rank requires setting some numerical tolerance levels. These choices are not always well defined.

For example, in the case that of two columns a and b where b = 2a, then the rank deficiency can be handled by eliminating either a or b. While we defined b here in terms of a, it may be that b is actually the more 'fundamental' predictor and hence we may define  a in terms of b as a = 0.5b.

In practice the determination of rank and the redundant coefficients is done via a 'pivoting' scheme during a decomposition to  move the surplus columns to the right side of the model matrix.
