These models are used in many different disciplines. Because the descriptions of the models can vary markedly between disciplines, we begin by describing what mixed-effects models are and by exploring a very simple example of one type of mixed model, the <em>linear mixed model</em>.</p><p>This simple example allows us to illustrate the use of the <code>lmm</code> function in the <code>MixedModels</code> package for fitting such models and other functions  for analyzing the fitted model. We also describe methods of assessing the precision of the parameter estimates and of visualizing the conditional distribution of the random effects, given the observed data.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Mixed-effects-Models-1" href="#Mixed-effects-Models-1">Mixed-effects Models</a></h2><p>Mixed-effects models, like many other types of statistical models, describe a relationship between a <em>response</em> variable and some of the <em>covariates</em> that have been measured or observed along with the response. In mixed-effects models at least one of the covariates is a <em>categorical</em> covariate representing experimental or observational “units” in the data set. In the example from the chemical industry discussed in this chapter, the observational unit is the batch of an intermediate product used in production of a dye. In medical and social sciences the observational units are often the human or animal subjects in the study. In agriculture the experimental units may be the plots of land or the specific plants being studied.</p><p>In all of these cases the categorical covariate or covariates are observed at a set of discrete <em>levels</em>. We may use numbers, such as subject identifiers, to designate the particular levels that we observed but these numbers are simply labels. The important characteristic of a categorical covariate is that, at each observed value of the response, the covariate takes on the value of one of a set of distinct levels.</p><p>Parameters associated with the particular levels of a covariate are sometimes called the “effects” of the levels. If the set of possible levels of the covariate is fixed and reproducible we model the covariate using <em>fixed-effects</em> parameters. If the levels that were observed represent a random sample from the set of all possible levels we incorporate <em>random effects</em> in the model.</p><p>There are two things to notice about this distinction between fixed-effects parameters and random effects. First, the names are misleading because the distinction between fixed and random is more a property of the levels of the categorical covariate than a property of the effects associated with them. Secondly, we distinguish between “fixed-effects parameters”, which are indeed parameters in the statistical model, and “random effects”, which, strictly speaking, are not parameters. As we will see shortly, random effects are unobserved random variables.</p><p>To make the distinction more concrete, suppose the objective is to model the annual reading test scores for students in a school district and that the covariates recorded with the score include a student identifier and the student’s gender. Both of these are categorical covariates. The levels of the gender covariate, <em>male</em> and <em>female</em>, are fixed. If we consider data from another school district or we incorporate scores from earlier tests, we will not change those levels. On the other hand, the students whose scores we observed would generally be regarded as a sample from the set of all possible students whom we could have observed. Adding more data, either from more school districts or from results on previous or subsequent tests, will increase the number of distinct levels of the student identifier.</p><p><em>Mixed-effects models</em> or, more simply, <em>mixed models</em> are statistical models that incorporate both fixed-effects parameters and random effects. Because of the way that we will define random effects, a model with random effects always includes at least one fixed-effects parameter. Thus, any model with random effects is a mixed model.</p><p>We characterize the statistical model in terms of two random variables: a <span>$q$</span>-dimensional vector of random effects represented by the random variable <span>$\mathcal{B}$</span> and an <span>$n$</span>-dimensional response vector represented by the random variable <span>$\mathcal{Y}$</span>. (We use upper-case “script” characters to denote random variables. The corresponding lower-case upright letter denotes a particular value of the random variable.) We observe the value, <span>$\bf{y}$</span>, of <span>$\mathcal{Y}$</span>. We do not observe the value, <span>$\bf{b}$</span>, of <span>$\mathcal{B}$</span>.</p><p>When formulating the model we describe the unconditional distribution of <span>$\mathcal{B}$</span> and the conditional distribution, <span>$(\mathcal{Y}|\mathcal{B}=\bf{b})$</span>. The descriptions of the distributions involve the form of the distribution and the values of certain parameters. We use the observed values of the response and the covariates to estimate these parameters and to make inferences about them.</p><p>That’s the big picture. Now let’s make this more concrete by describing a particular, versatile class of mixed models called <em>linear mixed models</em> and by studying a simple example of such a model. First we describe the data in the example.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="The-Dyestuff-and-Dyestuff2-Data-1" href="#The-Dyestuff-and-Dyestuff2-Data-1">The <code>Dyestuff</code> and <code>Dyestuff2</code> Data</a></h2><p>Models with random effects have been in use for a long time. The first edition of the classic book, <em>Statistical Methods in Research and Production</em>, edited by O.L. Davies, was published in 1947 and contained examples of the use of random effects to characterize batch-to-batch variability in chemical processes. The data from one of these examples are available as <code>Dyestuff</code> in the <code>MixedModels</code> package. In this section we describe and plot these data and introduce a second example, the <code>Dyestuff2</code> data, described in Box and Tiao (1973).</p><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="The-Dyestuff-Data-1" href="#The-Dyestuff-Data-1">The <code>Dyestuff</code> Data</a></h3><p>The data are described in Davies (), the fourth edition of the book mentioned above, as coming from</p><blockquote><p>an investigation to find out how much the variation from batch to batch in the quality of an intermediate product (H-acid) contributes to the variation in the yield of the dyestuff (Naphthalene Black 12B) made from it. In the experiment six samples of the intermediate, representing different batches of works manufacture, were obtained, and five preparations of the dyestuff were made in the laboratory from each sample. The equivalent yield of each preparation as grams of standard colour was determined by dye-trial.</p></blockquote><p>First attach the packages to be used</p><pre><code class="language-julia">julia&gt; using DataFrames, Distributions, GLM, LinearAlgebra, MixedModels

In a plot, however, the order of the levels influences the perception of the pattern.

</code></pre><p>In Sect. [sec:DyestuffLMM] we will use mixed models to quantify the variability in yield between batches. For the time being let us just note that the particular batches used in this experiment are a selection or sample from the set of all batches that we wish to consider. Furthermore, the extent to which one particular batch tends to increase or decrease the mean yield of the process — in other words, the “effect” of that particular batch on the yield — is not as interesting to us as is the extent of the variability between batches. For the purposes of designing, monitoring and controlling a process we want to predict the yield from future batches, taking into account the batch-to-batch variability and the within-batch variability. Being able to estimate the extent to which a particular batch in the past increased or decreased the yield is not usually an important goal for us. We will model the effects of the batches as random effects rather than as fixed-effects parameters.</p><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="The-Dyestuff2-Data-1" href="#The-Dyestuff2-Data-1">The <code>Dyestuff2</code> Data</a></h3><p>The data are simulated data presented in Box and Tiao (1973), where the authors state</p><blockquote><p>These data had to be constructed for although examples of this sort undoubtedly occur in practice they seem to be rarely published.</p></blockquote><p>The structure and summary are intentionally similar to those of the <code>Dyestuff</code> data.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">julia&gt; dyestuff2 = dat[:Dyestuff2];

</code></pre><p>As shown in the summary of the model fit, the default estimation criterion is maximum likelihood. The summary provides several other model-fit statistics such as Akaike’s Information Criterion (<code>AIC</code>), Schwarz’s Bayesian Information Criterion (<code>BIC</code>), the log-likelihood at the parameter estimates, and the objective function (negative twice the log-likelihood) at the parameter estimates. These are all statistics related to the model fit and are used to compare different models fit to the same data.</p><p>The third section is the table of estimates of parameters associated with the random effects. There are two sources of variability in this model, a batch-to-batch variability in the level of the response and the residual or per-observation variability — also called the within-batch variability. The name “residual” is used in statistical modeling to denote the part of the variability that cannot be explained or modeled with the other terms. It is the variation in the observed data that is “left over” after determining the estimates of the parameters in the other parts of the model.</p><p>Some of the variability in the response is associated with the fixed-effects terms. In this model there is only one such term, labeled the <code>(Intercept)</code>. The name “intercept”, which is better suited to models based on straight lines written in a slope/intercept form, should be understood to represent an overall “typical” or mean level of the response in this case. (For those wondering about the parentheses around the name, they are included so that a user cannot accidentally name a variable in conflict with this name.) The line labeled <code>Batch</code> in the random effects table shows that the random effects added to the intercept term, one for each level of the factor, are modeled as random variables whose unconditional variance is estimated as 1388.33 g<span>$^2$</span>. The corresponding standard deviations is 37.26 g for the ML fit.</p><p>Note that the last column in the random effects summary table is the estimate of the variability expressed as a standard deviation rather than as a variance. These are provided because it is usually easier to visualize the variability in standard deviations, which are on the scale of the response, than it is to visualize the magnitude of a variance. The values in this column are a simple re-expression (the square root) of the estimated variances. Do not confuse them with the standard errors of the variance estimators, which are not given here. As described in later sections, standard errors of variance estimates are generally not useful because the distribution of the estimator of a variance is skewed - often badly skewed.</p><p>The line labeled <code>Residual</code> in this table gives the estimate, 2451.25 g<span>$^2$</span>, of the variance of the residuals and the corresponding standard deviation, 49.51 g. In written descriptions of the model the residual variance parameter is written <span>$\sigma^2$</span> and the variance of the random effects is <span>$\sigma_1^2$</span>. Their estimates are <span>$\widehat{\sigma^2}$</span> and <span>$\widehat{\sigma_1^2}$</span></p><p>The last line in the random effects table states the number of observations to which the model was fit and the number of levels of any “grouping factors” for the random effects. In this case we have a single random effects term, <code>(1 | Batch)</code>, in the model formula and the grouping factor for that term is <code>Batch</code>.

Indeed Fig. [fig:Dyestuff2dot] shows that there is some small amount of variability between the groups. The estimate, <span>$\widehat{\sigma_1}$</span>, is a measure of the “between-group” variability that is <strong>in excess of</strong> the variability induced by the &quot;within-group&quot; or residual variability in the responses.  </p><p>If 30 observations were simulated from a &quot;normal&quot; (also called &quot;Gaussian&quot;) distribution and divided arbitrarily into 6 groups of 5, a plot of the data would look very much like Fig. [fig:Dyestuff2dot].

Obtaining <span>$\widehat{\sigma_1}=0$</span> is not a mistake; it is simply a statement about the data and the model.</p><p>The important point to take away from this example is the need to allow for the estimates of variance components that are zero. Such a model is said to be <em>singular</em>, in the sense that it corresponds to a linear model in which we have removed the random effects associated with <code>Batch</code>. Singular models can and do occur in practice. Even when the final fitted model is not singular, we must allow for such models to be expressed when determining the parameter estimates through numerical optimization.</p><p>It happens that this model corresponds to the linear model (i.e. a model with fixed-effects only)</p><pre><code class="language-julia">julia&gt; lm1 = lm(@formula(Y ~ 1), dyestuff2)

However, they are not the whole story. Statistical models characterize the variability in the data and we must assess the effect of this variability on the parameter estimates and on the precision of predictions made from the model.</p><p>In Sect. [sec:variability] we introduce a method of assessing variability in parameter estimates using the “profiled log-likelihood” and in Sect. [sec:assessRE] we show methods of characterizing the conditional distribution of the random effects given the data. Before we get to these sections, however, we should state in some detail the probability model for linear mixed-effects and establish some definitions and notation. In particular, before we can discuss profiling the log-likelihood, we should define the log-likelihood. We do that in the next section.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="The-Linear-Mixed-effects-Probability-Model-1" href="#The-Linear-Mixed-effects-Probability-Model-1">The Linear Mixed-effects Probability Model</a></h2><p>In explaining some of parameter estimates related to the random effects we have used terms such as “unconditional distribution” from the theory of probability.

It is the value to be minimized by the parameter estimates.  It is, up to an additive factor, the <em>deviance</em> of the parameters.  Unfortunately, it is not clear what the additive factor should be in the case of linear mixed models.  In many applications, however, it is not the deviance of the model that is of interest as much the change in the deviance between two fitted models.  When calculating the change in the deviance the additive factor will cancel out so the change in the deviance when comparing models is the same as the change in this objective.</p><p>Because the conditional mean, <span>$\bf\mu_{\mathcal Y|\mathcal B=\bf b}=\bf X\bf\beta+\bf Z\Lambda_\theta\bf u$</span>, is a linear function of both <span>$\bf\beta$</span> and <span>$\bf u$</span>, minimization of the PRSS with respect to both <span>$\bf\beta$</span> and <span>$\bf u$</span> to produce</p><div>\[\begin{equation}

The values of <span>$\bf u$</span> and <span>$\bf\beta$</span> that provide this minimum are called, respectively, the <em>conditional mode</em>, <span>$\tilde{\bf u}_\theta$</span>, of the spherical random effects and the conditional estimate, <span>$\widehat{\bf\beta}_\theta$</span>, of the fixed effects. At the conditional estimate of the fixed effects the objective is</p><div>\[\begin{equation}
d({\bf\theta},\widehat{\beta}_\theta,\sigma|{\bf y})
=n\log(2\pi\sigma^2)+\log(|{\bf L}_\theta|^2)+\frac{r^2_\theta}{\sigma^2}.
\end{equation}\]</div><p>Minimizing this expression with respect to <span>$\sigma^2$</span> produces the conditional estimate</p><div>\[\begin{equation}

\tilde{d}(\theta|{\bf y})=d(\theta,\widehat{\beta}_\theta,\widehat{\sigma}_\theta|{\bf y})
=\log(|{\bf L}_\theta|^2)+n\left[1+\log\left(\frac{2\pi r^2_\theta}{n}\right)\right],
\end{equation}\]</div><p>a function of <span>$\bf\theta$</span> alone.</p><p>The MLE of <span>$\bf\theta$</span>, written <span>$\widehat{\bf\theta}$</span>, is the value that minimizes this profiled objective.

Well chosen plots can provide insights not available from a simple numerical summary. It is common to visualize the distribution of a sample using a <em>histogram</em>, which approximates the shape of the probability density function. The density can also be approximated more smoothly using a <em>kernel density</em> plot. Finally, the extent to which the distribution of a sample can be approximated by a particular distribution or distribution family can be assessed by a <em>quantile-quantile (qq) plot</em>, the most common of which is the <em>normal probability plot</em>.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/GiovineItalia/Gadfly.jl"><code>Gadfly</code></a> package for Julia uses a &quot;grammar of graphics&quot; specification, similar to the <a href="http://ggplot2.org/"><code>ggplot2</code></a> package for R.

The standard deviation or, in some cases, the logarithm of the standard deviation is a more suitable scale.</p><p>The histogram of <span>$\sigma_1^2$</span> has a &quot;spike&quot; at zero.  Because the value of <span>$\sigma^2$</span> is never zero, a value of <span>$\sigma_1^2=0$</span> must correspond to <span>$\theta=0$</span>.  There are several ways to count the zeros in <code>theta1</code>.

</code></pre><p>The standard approach of summarizing a sample by its mean and standard deviation, or of constructing a confidence interval using the sample mean, the standard error of the mean and quantiles of a <em>t</em> or normal distribution, are based on the assumption that the sample is approximately normal (also called Gaussian) in shape.  A <em>normal probability plot</em>, which plots sample quantiles versus quantiles of the standard normal distribution, <span>$\mathcal{N}(0,1)$</span>, can be used to assess the validity of this assumption.  If the points fall approximately along a straight line, the assumption of normality should be valid.  Systematic departures from a straight line are cause for concern.</p><p>In Gadfly a normal probability plot can be  constructed by specifying the statistic to be generated as <code>Stat.qq</code> and either <code>x</code> or <code>y</code> as the distribution <code>Normal()</code>. For the present purposes it is an advantage to put the theoretical quantiles on the <code>x</code> axis.</p><p>This approach is suitable for small to moderate sample sizes, but not for sample sizes of 10,000.  To smooth the plot and to reduce the size of the plot files, we plot quantiles defined by a sequence of <code>n</code> &quot;probability points&quot;.  These are constructed by partitioning the interval (0, 1) into <code>n</code> equal-width subintervals and returning the midpoint of each of the subintervals.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">julia&gt; function ppoints(n)

However, they are not appropriate for skewed and/or bounded estimator distributions, such as those for <span>$\sigma^2$</span> and <span>$\sigma_2^1$</span> shown above.</p><p>The fact that a symmetric confidence interval is not appropriate for <span>$\sigma^2$</span> should not be surprising.  In an introductory statistics course the calculation of a confidence interval on <span>$\sigma^2$</span> from a random sample of a normal distribution using quantiles of a <span>$\chi^2$</span> distribution is often introduced. So a symmetric confidence interval on <span>$\sigma^2$</span> is inappropriate in the simplest case but is often expected to be appropriate in much more complicated cases, as shown by the fact that many statistical software packages include standard errors of variance component estimates in the output from a mixed model fitting procedure.  Creating confidence intervals in this way is optimistic at best. Completely nonsensical would be another way of characterizing this approach.</p><p>A more reasonable alternative for constructing a <span>$1 - \alpha$</span> confidence interval from a bootstrap sample is to report a contiguous interval that contains a <span>$1 - \alpha$</span> proportion of the sample values.</p><p>But there are many such intervals.  Suppose that a 95% confidence interval was to be constructed from one of the samples of size 10,000 of bootstrapped values.  To get a contigous interval the sample should be sorted. The sorted sample values, also called the <em>order statistics</em> of the sample, are denoted by a bracketed subscript.  That is, <span>$\sigma_{[1]}$</span> is the smallest value in the sample, <span>$\sigma_{[2]}$</span> is the second smallest, up to <span>$\sigma_{[10,000]}$</span>, which is the largest.</p><p>One possible interval containing 95% of the sample is <span>$(\sigma_{[1]}, \sigma_{[9500]})$</span>.  Another is <span>$(\sigma_{[2]}, \sigma_{[9501]})$</span> and so on up to <span>$(\sigma_{[501]},\sigma_{[10000]})$</span>.  There needs to be a method of choosing one of these intervals.  On approach would be to always choose the central 95% of the sample.  That is, cut off 2.5% of the sample on the left side and 2.5% on the right side.  </p><pre><code class="language-julia">julia&gt; sigma95 = quantile(mm1bstp[:σ], [0.025, 0.975])

</code></pre><p>An alternative approach is to evaluate all of the contiguous intervals containing, say, 95% of the sample and return the shortest shortest such interval.  This is the equivalent of a <em>Highest Posterior Density (HPD)</em> interval sometimes used in Bayesian analysis.  If the procedure is applied to a unimodal (i.e. one that has only one peak or <em>mode</em>) theoretical probability density the resulting interval has the property that the density at the left endpoint is equal to the density at the right endpoint and that the density at any point outside the interval is less than the density at any point inside the interval.  Establishing this equivalence is left as an exercise for the mathematically inclined reader.  (Hint: Start with the interval defined by the &quot;equal density at the endpoints&quot; property and consider what happens if you shift that interval while maintaining the same area under the density curve.  You will be replacing a region of higher density by one with a lower density and the interval must become wider to maintain the same area.)</p><p>With large samples a brute-force enumeration approach works.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">julia&gt; function hpdinterval(v, level=0.95)

It can be helpful to think of them this way but it can also be misleading. As we have stated, the random effects are not, strictly speaking, parameters—they are unobserved random variables. We don’t estimate the random effects in the same sense that we estimate parameters. Instead, we consider the conditional distribution of <span>$\mathcal B$</span> given the observed data, <span>$(\mathcal B|\mathcal Y=\mathbf  y)$</span>.</p><p>Because the unconditional distribution, <span>$\mathcal B\sim\mathcal{N}(\mathbf  0,\Sigma_\theta)$</span> is continuous, the conditional distribution, <span>$(\mathcal B|\mathcal Y=\mathbf  y)$</span> will also be continuous. In general, the mode of a probability density is the point of maximum density, so the phrase “conditional mode” refers to the point at which this conditional density is maximized. Because this definition relates to the probability model, the values of the parameters are assumed to be known. In practice, of course, we don’t know the values of the parameters (if we did there would be no purpose in forming the parameter estimates), so we use the estimated values of the parameters to evaluate the conditional modes.</p><p>Those who are familiar with the multivariate Gaussian distribution may recognize that, because both <span>$\mathcal B$</span> and <span>$(\mathcal Y|\mathcal B=\mathbf  b)$</span> are multivariate Gaussian, <span>$(\mathcal B|\mathcal Y=\mathbf  y)$</span> will also be multivariate Gaussian and the conditional mode will also be the conditional mean of <span>$\mathcal B$</span>, given <span>$\mathcal Y=\mathbf  y$</span>. This is the case for a linear mixed model but it does not carry over to other forms of mixed models. In the general case all we can say about <span>$\tilde{\mathbf    u}$</span> or <span>$\tilde{\mathbf  b}$</span> is that they maximize a conditional density, which is why we use the term “conditional mode” to describe these values.

If the expression on the left of the vertical bar is , as it is here, we describe the term as a <em>simple, scalar, random-effects term</em>. The designation “scalar” means there will be exactly one random effect generated for each level of the grouping factor.

Density plots derived from the profile zeta function provide another way of examining the distribution of the estimators of the parameters.</p><p>Prediction intervals from the conditional distribution of the random effects, given the observed data, allow us to assess the precision of the random effects.</p><h1><a class="nav-anchor" id="Notation-1" href="#Notation-1">Notation</a></h1><h4><a class="nav-anchor" id="Random-Variables-1" href="#Random-Variables-1">Random Variables</a></h4><ul><li><div>\[\mathcal Y\]</div><p>: The responses (<span>$n$</span>-dimensional Gaussian)</p></li><li><div>\[\mathcal B\]</div><p>: The random effects on the original scale (<span>$q$</span>-dimensional Gaussian with mean <span>$\mathbf 0$</span>)</p></li><li><div>\[\mathcal U\]</div><p>: The orthogonal random effects (<span>$q$</span>-dimensional spherical Gaussian)</p></li></ul><p>Values of these random variables are denoted by the corresponding bold-face, lower-case letters: <span>$\mathbf y$</span>, <span>$\mathbf b$</span> and <span>$\mathbf u$</span>.
